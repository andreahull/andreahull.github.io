## by Hilary Mckay 

i can&#8217;t remember now where i found a link for this [ah! i remembered: it was a [sonderbook standout for 2003][1], and i agree with so many of this woman&#8217;s reviews] but this was a great book. it wasn&#8217;t fantasy.. at least not *quite*, nor even magical realism&#8230; not *quite* but it still had that feeling of possibility that i love.

saffy&#8217;s family is a creative, loving, individualistic jumble, and the best part of the whole book &#8211; really, they *are* the book. and how the author managed to slide in a really sweet love story on the side amazed me.

but even better is the writing &#8211; at first, too jangly for me, but quickly i caught up and just loved it. there&#8217;s so much *spark* in this book &#8211; and though that might sound just lazy reviewing, i really can&#8217;t think of a better word. 

here&#8217;s a good sentence to prove to you what i mean: &#8220;The Banana House has always had a slightly magical feel about it, and this was because it was one of those places that appear to be bigger on the inside than they do on the outside.&#8221; love it.
