      the cover illustration for this book is very deceptive, it doesnâ€™t even begin to match the beauty and sophistication of the story within (though that&#8217;s not to say i don&#8217;t like the illustration. having read the book, i can now appreciate the hazy beauty of it, almost like modern animation..)

      so, i liked the cover, thatâ€™s partially why i chose the book (yeah, iâ€™m like that), but the story just kept surprising me and surprising me with its twists, turns and depth.
