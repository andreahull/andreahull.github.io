hi. yesterday was a good day, albeit pretty frustrating.. at work, we&#8217;re going a little crazy since not only are the national conventions quickly approaching (i.e. a lot of work for us preparing for special broadcasts of past convention coverage), but there&#8217;s also a major site redesign that we&#8217;re hoping to unveil tuesday next week. yikes! .. so, very busy at work.

but i love this one boy, mmmm. and in general i feel pretty happy and good about my life. so busy is o.k.

in three weeks, i&#8217;m off to boston for the [saa][1] conference and then italy two weeks later, hip hip hooray. and i just found out that the sister of my first boyfriend, this great girl, she&#8217;s getting married in april ~ auguri marica!

more later, promise (and i am *determined* to finish my scarf tonight though i&#8217;m a tad nervous about binding off in pattern)
