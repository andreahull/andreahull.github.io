cannot wait until [sicko][1] comes out. june 29th, hurry up already! [here&#8217;s][2] a good moore fix for you until then. edit: and [here&#8217;s another][3]!<span class="picl"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="1162" /></span>

in other news, busy making paper, and even teaching paper, almost every day, trying to figure out computer problems, <span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="1163" /></span>teaching feltmaking tonight, a lot of online time, and remembering to shower, eat, and sleep in between. things will slow down after tomorrow, for a little bit at least, but it&#8217;s been a busy week. .. it always is though, isn&#8217;t it? also, i got a cheesemaking kit ~ very excited about that but so far just a lot of sighing as i look through the instructions. 

oh! good news: i&#8217;m a substitute librarian for my local county&#8217;s library system <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> i applied for the job a while back, forgot about it for a while, and then, months later, was interviewed and a few weeks later offered the position. it&#8217;s a very flexible job that allows me to travel all around the county, getting a feel for the different branches. it pays well *and* it&#8217;s a union job, yay.<span class="picl"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="1164" /></span> i don&#8217;t start for a few weeks still, but wow, in just a little over a month, i went from no jobs to two jobs, albeit both part-part-time. phew! 

<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="1165" /></span>here&#8217;s some nice pics of some family babies & me from this past weekend. i&#8217;m trying to use my camera more, but it&#8217;s so easy to forget and be lazy about it. btw, since i don&#8217;t have photoshop access right now, i used [picnik][4] for free online editing of my photos. very handy. 

lastly, to each one of you who read this, reading about me and my life, thank you ~ you all rock.

[pictures, top to bottom, left to right: the oldest grandchild with the youngest; me striking a pose; my goddaughter staring at the ceiling fan, &#8220;sweet & cool!&#8221;; the littlest baby girl thinks she&#8217;s a dog. ]

update: hmph! i just found out that i haven&#8217;t been getting some email recently.. i use gmail for all my various email accounts &#8211; i just forward everything to gmail &#8211; and, for some reason, lately it&#8217;s been taking a few *days* to get certain account&#8217;s emails to me. grumble grumble. so, if you haven&#8217;t heard from me, give me a couple days to figure this out, or leave a comment here, thanks.
