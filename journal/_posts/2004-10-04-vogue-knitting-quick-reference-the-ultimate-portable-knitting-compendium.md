## by Trisha Malcolm 

i was so excited to get this book &#8211; and it *is* useful, but&#8230; i don&#8217;t know, it just feels badly organized, way too dry, and kind of snobby too! plus the illustrations haven&#8217;t been that helpful so far and the explanations are annoyingly vague. maybe it&#8217;s just me &#8211; everyone else seems to be crazy about this book. 

besides, the patterns at the back are down right ugly.
