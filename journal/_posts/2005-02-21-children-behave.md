<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="156" /></span>hi there &#8211; my weekend was fantastic but this morning i woke with a nasty stomach-something-or-other so i&#8217;m staying home today.. probably has something to do with the 3+ betty crocker blueberry muffins with the crumbly-sugar topping i gobbld up late last night. (i added that plus sign because after that third muffin, it all got a bit hazy for me..) 

so. 

1) is anyone else very excited about this whole [frozen sea][1] discovered on mars?! i mean, it&#8217;s like science fiction coming to life, yippee! i&#8217;m such a closet-scifi-dork and that dork right now is yipping so happily.

2) i did a bunch of movie watching this weekend: the last waltz (incredible!), ray (sucked big-time), bread & tulips (surprisingly good! and in italian, an added bonus), and spinal tap (overrated and most funny *afterwards*, while reminiscing on favorite lines). i gotta say, though, that fran drescher is *smoking* in spinal tap &#8211; and this outfit of hers? to die for. i&#8217;m loving this sweater so much, i gotta gotta figure out how to make it.<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="154" /></span>

3) i&#8217;m almost done with a certain knitted project that will not be named. cross your fingers for me &#8212; i can&#8217;t say any more because i&#8217;m a terrible self-jinxer. 

4) i finally got off my butt and submitted two book reviews to [you grow girl][2], an online gardening journal, as well as forum, blog, and more &#8211; basically a knitty for the gardening-set (and aren&#8217;t we all part of that set? or at least want to be?) yeehaw!

5) i sold about half my cd collection this weekend &#8211; the half that is both easily replaceable *and* has no real big emotional attachments. however, $70 for 45 cds left me feeling somewhat like a chump &#8211; i mean, i paid easily $500 (over the course of many years) for all those cds! man, somebody&#8217;s making a fortune and it is definitely not me. nor is it [the][3] [artists][4], i must say.

6) it&#8217;s [raining][5]. [again][6]. i just heard thunder &#8212; thank god i taped up [that broken window][7]! and yes, i&#8217;m the worst procrastinator in the world &#8212; you know, i&#8217;ll get that window fixed as soon as the rainy season is over. of course.

7) it seems the latest interweave&#8217;s knits isn&#8217;t thrilling people to death but am i the only one that loves *loves* [anne modesitt][8]&#8216;s [fiited dolman][9]?
