i&#8217;m in a sentimental mood tonight, a nice mellow one that&#8217;s all the more pleasant knowing i have zip plans for tomorrow, i.e. i can sleep in till noon if i wish. lovely. anyhow, the sentimentality comes from sweet old friends, friends i&#8217;ve broken bread with and laughed with and etc etc. i just plain sigh with happiness at the prospect of hanging out with any and all of them again. even lovelier!

a fantastic high school friend who always had a great head on his shoulders got in touch with me and our subsequent emailing has me very happy, i hung out with an amazingly creative and sweet former [co-worker][1] last weeked and talked her ear off, and now i just got a possible job referral from another former co-worker who has always very obviously been a kindred spirit (and gave me that great little [swift][2] a while back!) ah, to be so lucky in friends! that makes me feel rich beyond belief. (getting so cheesy, geez!) .. i should throw them all a party. seriously! hm, how many people can i fit in this studio apartment? &#8230; 

i wish i had a photo to show what i&#8217;m feeling &#8211; but for now, words will have to do. here&#8217;s hoping we&#8217;re all appreciative of such friends &#8211; i know right now, i definitely am. yay to all of you!
