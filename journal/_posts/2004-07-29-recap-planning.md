hello. i just finalized my italy plans, at least how i&#8217;m getting there and getting back. i&#8217;ll have one full day in maryland before i leave with my little sisters to join my parents and my older sister and her husband and i&#8217;ll have a night in maryland when we all come back on the 28th so that i can chill and relax one last night. this way, i can spend some time with my adorable niece and nephew as well as my very-cool brother and sister-in-law.

also, i&#8217;m getting ready for the saa conference in boston next week ~ very exciting ~ and, from boston, i&#8217;ll also be taking the train down to new york for some meetings, so i&#8217;m hoping to meet up with my oldest friend in the world, who i still have to contact.. yikes. it&#8217;s hard to get everything together but i cannot wait! i just found out there&#8217;s going to be a guided walk around boston highlighting anarchist-connected sites, focusing on [sacco & vanzetti][1]. also, i want to check out that [lucy parsons center][2], and in new york, the [bluestocking][3] bookstore.. any other recommendations? i&#8217;m only in boston for three days and in new york for two but i&#8217;m going to try and pack things in.. (argh. i feel all run-on sentences today.)

on tuesday night i hung out with some old friends and former co-workers caroline and maria. we were (sucessfully) trying to get together once a month or so and eat a lot (they&#8217;re big foodies) and talk a lot but it&#8217;s been six months since we last did that so we were way over due. i had a brand-new [fondue][4] pot and boy did it get used! between the three of us, we ate a pound and a half of cheese and for dessert we had chocolate fondue. yum. it was incredibly delicious. i always like hanging out with them, we&#8217;re all three very different people that are all interested in each other&#8217;s lives and find each other funny and smart. so, a lively discussion with some (invariably) dropping of bread and veggies in fondue pot. very fun.

knitting-wise: ok, i&#8217;m a little slow-moving recently with my to-be-felted-bag but i just finished the bottom (involving no less than a three-needle bind-off) and feel very proud. i love binding off, it&#8217;s so very satisfying (and easy and looks pretty to boot). i&#8217;m getting nervous about the actual felting process since on the local stitch n bitch listserv a few people were writing about how cascade yarns doesn&#8217;t felt up too well. i swatched by hand and though it was a little gappy in the middle, i think in a machine it would work fine. but i&#8217;m still nervous.
