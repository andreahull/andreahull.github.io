help me out here, what do you think? if i do attach the poms, they&#8217;ll be attached loosely, with some braided yarn between the top and the poms themselves. hm.

thank you for all your sweet comments about my iris demi-shawl, they make me verrry happy! i&#8217;ve worn it contstantly for the past few days and it&#8217;s just as warm as i thought it&#8217;d be, yay.

i&#8217;ve spent the last few days just organizing the busy stuff in my life &#8211; all my clothes, all my bills, old and new paperwork, the fridge, threw out the christmas tree. even handwashed the delicates! and, even better, i have a space for a wheel just big enough, hee. ah, i just like to *write* about a wheel, but really it&#8217;s still a bit off till when i get one. <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" />

in all that frenzy though, last night i came back to my apartment, after a long day at ucla, and found i had *left the door unlocked*!! not only that, but the door wasn&#8217;t even pulled all the way shut!! thankfully, the cats were safe and nothing was taken. i am so lucky! and so very thoughtless sometimes. ay! can you believe it. i still can&#8217;t, still find myself scared with all the &#8220;what ifs&#8221;, still shaking my head muttering &#8220;can&#8217;t believe it!&#8221; 

i finally used some gift certificates given to me by my friend [lalitha][1], thank you! so i&#8217;m off to the post office to pick up two books, yee-haw. one is [deborah madison][2]&#8217;s humungous &#8216;vegetarian cooking for everybody&#8217;, which ever since [miri][3] told me about and liz [baked with][4] (btw, check out liz&#8217;s [new digs][5]!), i&#8217;ve been itching to get, and [deb menz][6]&#8217;s &#8216;color in spinning&#8217; since i&#8217;m determined to learn color theory. a certain someone &#8211; cough[julia][7]cough &#8211; mentioned something about dyeing on her new deck, so i&#8217;m patiently waiting and in the meantime, learning all i can. <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> 

happy day to you all ~
