so, to really strrrrreeeetch out my birthday, let me recap what i did this past week: a whole lot of shopping, lots of cheese eating (in pizza form, delicious mole-covered enchiladas, etc etc), family story sharing as well as general/juicy family gossip, me getting lost almost every time we got in the car (so embarassing!), and a total organization overhaul of my apartment. 

(my mom has, it turns out, been watching a lot of those &#8216;design by demand&#8217;, &#8216;room makeover&#8217;, etc shows on cable and so was *really* into buying tons of boxes and containers and shelving for me <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> so sweet but a ton of work. as a result, however, my general ant and other insects-that-will-go-unnamed problems have vanished. also, that musty seemingly-permanent apartment smell has also disappeared. yay for moms!)

i knitted up a scarf for a cousin of mine&#8212;since my mom is going straight from l.a. to bolivia (where she&#8217;ll be for a month, lucky mami!), she&#8217;ll be able to give it directly to my cousin whereas bolivian mail is kinda sketchy&#8212;which you see below. it&#8217;s the [butterfly scarf][1] from the new stitch n&#8217; bitch, with some modifications. for more info & general specs, go [to the project page][2].

<div style="text-align: center; border: 1px dotted silver; padding-top: 11px; margin: 7px;">

just for fun, i also threw in that last pic of my mom at the surprise office bday party on friday&#8212;isn&#8217;t she so cute?!
