<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="838" /></span> ~ this friday i&#8217;m off to a [fiber retreat][1] &#8211; mostly spinning, but also felting and knitting and who knows what else. should be awesome. i have several pounds of fiber to play with and some great new spinning books, so i&#8217;m ready for the weekend. yay. 

~ sometime next week, i&#8217;ll receive the yarn to start the urban aran (which for the longest time i kept calling the urban armor). cannot. wait. especially after seeing [brooklyntweed][2]&#8216;s version. following the [trend][3], i&#8217;m making it a cardigan and using elann&#8217;s peruvian highland chunky, for which i just happened to have a color card.

~ i&#8217;m about halfway through the madli shawl, but i plan on slowing down a bit since my hands hurt after an hour or two. mixing it up with the urban aran should definitely help, though.<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="839" /></span>

~ i can spin woolen! all my yarn up to now has been worsted, which i like, but woolen is so light and fluffy and, more than anything, i just enjoy knowing i can do it. at least i think i did it.. <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> the lovely fiber was a gift from my friend [rose][4], who i hung out with a lot last weekend. thanks rose!

~ got my hair [dyed][5] today. it&#8217;s darrrrrk. i like it. but it&#8217;s bound to lighten up a bit in the next few washes, so i&#8217;ll wait to post pics. quite a shock from the whole uber-blonde look i&#8217;ve had the last year or so.

~ my great fiber friend francesca just started a blog, [fluffbuff][6] &#8211; welcome! she&#8217;s very cool and has adorable cats, check it out.

<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="840" /></span>~ along with a few other l.a. folks, i signed up for [camp pluckyfluff][7] this august. should be a ton of fun, plus i&#8217;ll come back making awesome yarn, promise.

~ my sister is pregnant **again**. yup, that&#8217;s right, she has an 18-month old, two 9-months, and is now a little over two months pregnant. can you say &#8220;crazy&#8221;?! of course, we&#8217;re all tickled pink. or blue. not sure yet.

~ i just accepted a mini-job proposal for the summer that has helped me go on a teeny shopping spree (i.e. the yarn, fiber, dyejob, and camp mentioned/pictured above). 

once again, thank goodness for fiber and online friends, without you all i&#8217;d be rocking myself to sleep at night. off to read a good book and chill out, hope your wednesday rocks ~
