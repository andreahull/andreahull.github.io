## by Debbie Stoller 

i had to get this book, though the patterns i&#8217;d seen online weren&#8217;t really spiking my interest (except for a few patterns, like the newsy hat, the felted bags, and the croc mitterns), just because the first was just so good. besides that, i heard the reference chapters in the beginning were extremely useful and told in the similarily-friendly way as in the first book.
