## by Candace Crockett 

card weaving, or tablet weaving at it&#8217;s sometimes called, is one of the oldest forms of weaving with the simplest tools needed to create beautiful practical works of art: yarn, square cards made of any stiff material, and a beater.

considered the classic book on card weaving for the beginner, this book also comes with a dozen cards to practice with. 

filled with projects, history, good illustrations, and clear writing, this a great book to dip your toes into the old craft of tablet weaving.
