fact #1: turtleneck shrug pattern calls for 23&#8221; sleeves  
fact #2: swatch showed some lengthening when blocked  
fact #3: as a result, i knit 21&#8221; sleeves  
fact #4: i proceeded to block &#8211; and sent a joyful &#8220;i&#8217;m done!&#8221; email to [cassie][1], my [syno][2] pal  
fact #5: two days of blocking later, i had 27&#8221; long sleeves. <span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="717" /></span>(sorry for the horrible pic..)

so. gulp. *silent shreak* froggin&#8217; away and re-knitting that sucker. i&#8217;m so sorry, cassie! but i have a feeling sleeves this long will do you no good! 

thankfully, this weekend i&#8217;ll have plent of time to do it. last time, it took about 4 days of knitting to do the whole thing, and since i&#8217;m only frogging down 17 inches(!), it should take only two days to fix this. (*so* jinxing myself) 

so, what&#8217;s the plan for this weekend?

~ the [california library association][3]&#8217;s annual conference in pasadena. on saturday (tomorrow! wow), i&#8217;ll be on a panel about blogs and rss &#8211; entitled &#8216;blah blah blog&#8217; &#8211; and i&#8217;m nervous but excited about that. plenty of kntting time at the conference.

~ sunday, i&#8217;ll be ducking out a bit early in order to go to the southern calif. handweavers&#8217; guild [annual festival][4]. definitely plenty of knitting time there. and, yes, the wallet will accompany me, oh my. it&#8217;s open to the public &#8211; so if you&#8217;re in the l.a. area, join me!<span class="pic"><txp:image id="715" /></span>

i joined mj&#8217;s new kal, [norwegian knits-along][5]! i ordered a [bea ellis hat kit][6] and am hoping the colors i chose work as well as they do in my mind.

happy weekend ~ and make sure to take in lots of water and vitamin c, there&#8217;s nasty colds going around. i was so sick last week i lost my voice for two days and was coughing up things *no one* wants to think about. yikes.
