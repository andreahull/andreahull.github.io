finished: september 24, 2006  
pattern: urban aran from patons&#8217; street smarts booklet  
yarn: a little less than 15 balls of elann&#8217;s peruvian highland chunky   
needles: size 9s; went down to size 7s for the collar

i started this project in late may, right as the hot l.a. summer started and finished all but the zipper in about three weeks. such a fast knit! i put off doing the zipper since it was toooo hot to even think about wearing a 100% wool product. but, late september, my fingers started itching and finally it&#8217;s done.

i modified the pattern, as others have ([loriz &#8211; handmade][1], [brooklyntweed][2], and [cosmicpluto][3]), so that it&#8217;d be a cardigan. it&#8217;s a lovely pattern but a little too confining bulk-wise for a sweater. the pattern is easily memorized and you get to *really* understand cable construction. 

ok, now the zipper. first off, double zipper all the way. this was my first zipper installation and i was pretty nervous about it, but it all ended up just fine. chicnits&#8217; [zipper tutorial][4] was very helpful, so definitely check it out! also, here i&#8217;ve included pics and some tips from that fun installation *day* (yes, it took me allll day, but hey, i learned! and next time, i&#8217;ll be flying fast.), figuring the more pics of zipper installations, the better place the internet will be. (ah, it&#8217;s been a long day.) 

the yarn is a bit scratchy for next-to-the-skin wear, though it softened up a ton in a nice bath of euculan. and it sheds like no tomorrow! no pilling as of yet, but hey, considering the price (less than $40 incl. shipping!) i&#8217;m wouldn&#8217;t complain anyhow.
