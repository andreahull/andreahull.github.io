hi there.  
i&#8217;ve become a pretty big list person, i have a list for everything *and* i keep those lists for years and years (i am an archivist-in-training, after all), even though the grand majority of them don&#8217;t get finished or even begun. i think it started in college, with tons of time in class for doodling or, in my case, list-making. i can listen with one ear and at the same time dream a productive life via my lists. lately, my lists have become really fun: to-do list when i have more money, &#8220;things i want to learn in the next 2 years&#8221; lists, &#8220;places i want to intern&#8221; lists, &#8220;books to read&#8221; lists, &#8220;places to visit&#8221; lists, etc etc. but of course, i get the most real joy out of the old standby &#8220;to do this weekend&#8221; lists. with all this talk about lists, you think i&#8217;m *not* going to list some right now? yeah, right. here:
