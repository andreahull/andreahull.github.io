<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="825" /></span>so. i&#8217;ve been back from maryland for two weeks now but you know what i miss the most &#8211; the babies!! there&#8217;s so many now &#8211; my eldest niece just got a bunkbed i promised to try out, my nephew is a complete terror and i love him to bits for that, my sister&#8217;s eldest daughter is learning <acronym title="american sign language">asl</acronym> (though she is starting to say some words, it&#8217;s amazing how much she uses the baby sign language, totally a la *meet the fockers*) and has the sweetest smile, and the [little][1] twins are.. well, as you can see, just beautiful. (that&#8217;s jesse, my god-daughter, on the left and jenna on the right &#8211; don&#8217;t you wish you were a twin!) i miss them miss them all more than anything, a serious ache that is just surprising me over and over again.. argh, why hasn&#8217;t [teleportation][2] been invented yet!! 

it&#8217;s hard to know when it&#8217;s ok to post pictures or not &#8211; they&#8217;re not my children and this *is* the internet after all. this one i decided was fine since it was already posted to my mom&#8217;s family listserv. there&#8217;s no pic of me with the babies since in each one taken, i look like a complete dork and/or my hair is greasy and freaky beyond belief. (i spent only 48 hours with those babies and still everything went out the window &#8211; sleep, showers, regular eating, etc. how does my sister do it?!) 

oh, i want babies i want babies i want babies. ..that&#8217;s part of my brain there, the other part is relieved i don&#8217;t have a single one since i&#8217;m nowhere near where i should be to have them responsibly.. but *look* at that photo. sigh. my aunt-ly-ness will have to do.

~ do you know about crazy aunt pearl&#8217;s [monthly horoscopes][5]? oof, this month they&#8217;re spot on.

~ [spring cleaning for your body][6]. i&#8217;ve read about that lemon water thing all over the place, so i bought a lemon and will do just that as soon as i get up from my bed <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> the rest sounds pretty good to me too. 

~ before i forget, while i was gone i used [downtown dogs][7]&#8217; services to watch over my cats and they did a fabulous job, highly recommended to all angelenos.

that&#8217;s it for now &#8211; my first class of my last quarter is today, &#8220;the oppositional & activist internet&#8221;. hopefully the rain will let up soon, i want to do some trapeze flying already!!

happy wednesday ~ ~ 

*&#8216;wawa&#8217; means baby in bolivian [quechua][8]. it was funny to me when i was going to school in philly and all the local convenience [stores][9] were called &#8216;wawa&#8217;, hee.
