hey there ~ yesterday was a lesson in procrastination &#8211; my umpteenth one that nope, i didn&#8217;t learn yet again. ah well, still got a ton done. not what was at the top of the list, but whatever. i&#8217;m still excited about it all because i made cheese! two kinds! so stoked.

i only have pics of the ricotta for now, but i also made [gjetost][1] &#8211; or at least a version of it. i plan on getting some fresh goat&#8217;s milk from someplace or another and making some chevre, mmm, and then truly authentic gjetost from the leftover whey. 

some links for fellow cheese enthusiasts: 

~ the original inspiration, [homemade ricotta recipe][2] via becks & posh nosh

~ a simple [paneer][3] recipe that&#8217;s basically the same thing

~ an [article][4] on what cheesemakers can do with all that leftover whey

~ one easy option is to use it in place of water, milk, or even broths in many recipes &#8211; like [these biscuits][5], as it packs a lot of nutrition and flavor.

~ the best part of that article was realizing i could make gjetost from whey &#8211; and [this page][6], set up by a fellow [cheese fanatic][7], shows the process easily. since i only had half a gallow on whey, that reduced to about a 1/4 cup of actual cheese that i ever so slightly burned <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" /> but it&#8217;s so darn close to the real thing, i could care less.

a good fiber post coming up early tomorrow &#8211; lots and lots of pics. i&#8217;m the process of seaming up my urban aran, though i still need to buy a zipper, and am impatiently waiting for the sleeves of crinkly to dry &#8211; cotton takes forever! especially in this weather. here&#8217;s to a lovely june weekend ~ ~ 

p.s. the book in that first pic is [Lost Arts: A Celebration of Culinary Traditions][8] by Lynn Alley and is filled with info about making your own vinegars, mustards, cheeses, and more. lovely!
