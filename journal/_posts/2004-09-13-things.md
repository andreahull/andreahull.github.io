that would make me really happy:

  * &#126; graduation
  * &#126; no more ants in my apartment.. ever
  * &#126; a clean smelling apartment when i walk in the door
  * &#126; a bed! 
  * &#126; clean clothing
  * &#126; longer hair, less frizz
  * &#126; good email and snail mail, maybe even a package or two
  * &#126; a regular excercise routine
  * &#126; weeks of no fights with him
  * &#126; sustained intense sweet good connection with him
  * &#126; a perfectly working no-headache refridgerator
  * &#126; wireless internet at home
  * &#126; a big pay raise
  * &#126; being hired permanently so i too can have benefits & paid holidays
  * &#126; no parking tickets for at least 6 months
  * &#126; my own parking space
  * &#126; a clean car with a trunk and horn that work & a un-bugged alarm so i can lock both doors of the car without fear of being locked out/in
  * &#126; cool weather, especially rain
  * &#126; not feeling like a bore/freak (it varies) when talking with other libr. students
  * &#126; get over feeling somewhat mannish just because i have short hair: what is this, the 1940s?
  * &#126; a totally paid off credit card
  * &#126; having lots of children some day
  * &#126; swimming in a not-too-cold running river with big rocks to lay on
  * &#126; kissing him & being kissed
  * &#126; getting more than enough sleep for a whole week

but some good news: [lunarpages ][1] increased my server space to 1 gb without me even asking (woOt!); for once i dressed warmly today and even brought in reinforcements (very strong a/c at work); i dyed my hair this weekend but no one at work has noticed, which is good news because i was dreading the fuss; and last but not least, [alexa][2] and [internet archive][3] started paying attention to this website last week, which although it doesn&#8217;t look like much right now, is still pretty exciting.
