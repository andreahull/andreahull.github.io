<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="1252" /></span>happy new year! 

i found a fairly reliable wifi connection &#8211; that i hope doesn&#8217;t disappear! &#8211; and am ready to start uploading some pictures and stories. i&#8217;ve been here in la paz, the capital of bolivia, for a week now and just yesterday finally found my sea legs, so to speak. hooray! my cousin susanna will arrive any minutes to take me to the *zona sur* where one aunt lives and lots of shops can be found. <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> after that, off to her house out in the wilderness for lunch, and then my sister and i will go pick up my parents in *achocalla*, the village where they&#8217;re building a house. it&#8217;s amazing, can&#8217;t wait to show you all pictures. yesterday i went for a long walk by myself in downtown la paz and got happily lost-and-then-found-again. independence is the best! 

ok, for now, a pic from new year&#8217;s &#8211; i hear my cousin&#8217;s little vw beetle pulling up&#8230;
