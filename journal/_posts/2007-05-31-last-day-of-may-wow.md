<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="1159" /></span>i&#8217;m still working on that longgggg to-do list, and have actually made another, with the first item being &#8220;finish online to-do list&#8221;.. ah, you know it&#8217;s bad when that happens. <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> yesterday i worked all day, came home and just collapsed for twelve+ hours of sleep. had really strange, and mostly upsetting, dreams the whole time &#8211; or what i could remember at least when i woke up this morning. thankfully, the dreams are now all gone from my head and have left only a faint dream-aftertaste. 

i feel like the ground is kind of shifting below my feet, beyond any control of mine and moving me around no matter how hard i try to stand my ground. i&#8217;m tired of willing things *to be* on my own, though i&#8217;m sure, as always, i&#8217;ll get an umpteenth wind at some point. <span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="1160" /></span>for today.. well, ten years ago i would have tried to sleep the day away. maybe because it&#8217;s too hot or maybe, as i like to think it, because i&#8217;ve matured, i&#8217;m just going to keep myself busy with no time to think and freak: babysitting, knitting, reading, cleaning, etc. if a handful of things go bad, or guilt gets thrown my way, etc., i might teeter over into sleep-the-day-away, but for right now, i can walk this tightrope, i can. i can even smile and skip a few daring steps.

the older i get, the more i realize how alone i am, how very much on my own i am. .. she says from her room in her parent&#8217;s attic on the way to her sister&#8217;s house. ha. but still, really, that&#8217;s how it is. it&#8217;s all up to me and i can&#8217;t tell you how strange that feels. you&#8217;d think a middle child in a big family would know that already, huh? <span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="1161" /></span>..somewhat i have a reluctance to post how down i really am &#8211; to really examine my downess <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> as i have in the past &#8211; because i know who reads my writings here (can&#8217;t help the truth!) and i don&#8217;t want my family, etc. all worried and feeling guilty (which they shouldn&#8217;t!), but partially i&#8217;ve just examined the downess (yes, it&#8217;s a made-up word) sooo many times already, i just have a kind of distance from it, from that part of me, at least today, right now, and that feels good. it&#8217;s sometimes worrisome how a person can split themselves into all these little compartments, but others time it&#8217;s a big old relief. 

so. that&#8217;s me today, at least as of 11:04 am. as always, some pics to lighten this whole post up: recent activities include some paper experiments, some knitting, and some spinning. they, and my cats, keep me sane and even inspired. hope you have similar sources of sanity & inspiration around *you* ~ ~
