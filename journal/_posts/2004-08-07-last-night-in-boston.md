well, this boston trip is ending on such a high note that, since i&#8217;m still not in my hotel, getting ready for sleep, i really feel i should find some wood to knock on before i jinx myself too much (note to self: must get wooden necklace, bracelet, whatever)..

for a while i&#8217;ve been looking forward to a walking tour of anarchist-related sites in boston and it was today, at 3:30. it&#8217;s almost 10:30 and i just left the group at the hotel as all were going back to their respective hotels and homes, but i just had such a great time. usually, i&#8217;m not that social, not really comfortable in general with chatting with folks, especially when i have to introduce myself, get over being shy, etc. (when is it **not** like that though, right?) but every once in a while i just click with folks and tonight i felt like that. yay! 

that kind of social-connection is in no way anything i can ever plan for or count on but i&#8217;m so glad it kicked in tonight ~ i met so many incredible people, very laid-back but all fascinating and encouraging. plus i got some really valuable advice career-wise that i need to do some serious thinking about.. yay, i&#8217;m still in a bit of shock it happened, but i also still have enough wine in me(boy, archivists with wine are like fish in water) to wonder, well since the night is going so well, although it&#8217;s 10:30 and i&#8217;m by myself now, maybe i should walk to the longfellow bridge (which connects cambridge to boston) and see the view of the charles river? .. 

(i&#8217;m mostly joking about the wine&#8217;s effect on me. as my typing shows, i&#8217;m fine and sober ~ though mildy buzzed. mostly it&#8217;s the ego-boost speaking.)

i didn&#8217;t get to go to more than one yarn store (nice but too expensive and small) and not at all to any bookstore, much less the lucy parson center/infoshop i wanted to see. and new york is looking just as busy. i&#8217;m definitely meeting up with my oldest friend in the world, but i don&#8217;t know what else i can do. the tour itself today started right near the hotel, in the boston commons (garder? park?) and wound its way up to the north end, super-italian part of boston ~ the focus was mostly on sacco & vanzetti and was great and really thorough. .. best of all, i finally got to **see** boston a bit, not just the ugly ritzy area around the hotel, but so much more. 

people in boston are so brassy. i really like that. i can&#8217;t help but immediately be aware of all the differences between boston and l.a. ~ really, it&#8217;s so different, with l.a. mostly paling in comparison. i hope it rains tonight; then i&#8217;ll be truly truly happy ~ cross your fingers for me.
