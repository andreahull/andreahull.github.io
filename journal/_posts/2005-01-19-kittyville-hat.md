i knitted this hat using addi circular needles and i was very impressed. my stitches were ego-soothingly perfect and even, to my very unexperienced eyes at least. but i didn&#8217;t like the clicky smooth feeling of them so, though i have two pairs of addi circular needles now, i prefer bamboo. we&#8217;ll see how long that lasts. 

the hat was lots of fun to make, especially the pompoms. yay! the ears came out looking more like teepees than cat ears, but the overall effect is still of a cat, so all&#8217;s well that ends well.

btw, that&#8217;s my adorable niece rileigh on christmas day &#8211; she&#8217;s a real cutie.
