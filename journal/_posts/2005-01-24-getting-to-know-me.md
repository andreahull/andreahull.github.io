## 1. Are you a yarn snob (do you prefer high-end and/or natural fibers)? Do you avoid Red Heart and Lion Brand? Or is it all the same to you?

no, it&#8217;s not really *all the same* to me <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> i do prefer natural fibers, though i&#8217;m not against a blend at all. basically, i like soft natural-looking yarn &#8211; oh , and i&#8217;m not crazy about most variegated yarn. it&#8217;s kinda wierd, i know, but there you have it.

## 2. Do you spin? Crochet?

i took a drop-spindle class in the summer and it was really fun but i haven&#8217;t done much since then. and no, i don&#8217;t crochet. knitting is enough for me, right now.

## 3. Do you have any allergies? (smoke, pets, fibers, perfume, etc.)

no allergies but i don&#8217;t like smoke-y yarn for sure.

## 4. How long have you been knitting?

since june 2004 &#8211; so, yup, i&#8217;m a newbie.

## 5. Do you have an Amazon or other online wish list?

i have one at [powells][1], but it&#8217;s more just to hold the info somewhere &#8211; better prices can be found usually at either [bookcloseouts.com][2] or [overstock.com][3].

## 6. What&#8217;s your favorite scent? (for candles, bath products etc.)

anything natural but not too floral, except for lavender. i also like patchouli and strong spicy scents.

## 7. Do you have a sweet tooth?

definitely, especially for sweet-and-sour gummy things!

## 8. What other crafts or Do-It-Yourself things do you like to do?

anything i can get my grubby hands on. i&#8217;ve sewed my own dresses and curtains, made stamps and magnets, bound my own books, and cooked like a madwoman &#8211; but all of these were done at a pretty basic level, just &#8216;sticking my toes in the water&#8217;, so to speak. i&#8217;m into pretty much into all craftsy stuff- anything that&#8217;s creative *and* practical, i love.

## 9. What kind of music do you like? Can your computer/stereo play MP3s? (if your buddy wants to make you a CD)

i&#8217;m a mac fiend, so yup, i can handle mp3s as well as wmas, oggs, etc. music-wise i basically like rock, and old pop music, too. now that i think about it, i like opera and classical music, and i love oldies. shoot, the 80s rocks, too and disco now and then lifts my mood. in other words, i like music a lot <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" />

## 10. What&#8217;s your favorite color? Or&#8212;do you have a color family/season/palette you prefer?

i like natural colors and deep reds. really, all colors work, but lately i&#8217;ve been drawn to any variations of red and real earthy colors.

## 11. What is your family situation? Do you have any pets?

i live in a teeny apartment in los angeles with two sweet grey cat friends.

## 12. What are your life dreams? (really stretching it here, I know)

argh. ummm. they&#8217;re *big*, that i know&#8230; i wanna be happy, independent, loved, loving, balanced, and always growing. i want to live near my family but not *super* near my family &#8211; and i want to live where there are seasons and snow and forests. i want to be proud of my job and feel like i&#8217;m contributing postively to humanity. and i want a fast internet connection forever and ever. oh, i could go on & on but i&#8217;ll stop there.. 

## 13. What is/are your favorite yarn/s to knit with?

i really loved knitting with the inca organic cotton stuff &#8211; though it shed like crazy, it was so smooth and nubbly and soft. i&#8217;m all about texture, that&#8217;s mainly why acrylic yarns in general don&#8217;t appeal to me. today i fondled (that *is* the correct word) some manos del uruguay yarn as well as some colinette and also brushed against some rowan felted tweed. all seemed so lovely, i wanted to take them home with me, but my wallet protested. sigh. really though, i&#8217;m so new to knitting that all i know are the big (expensive) names, but i&#8217;m not in the least bit biased against any yarn that feel soft and delicious.

## 14. What fibers do you absolutely **not** like?

none of that fun fur stuff, or anything novelty, really. i like old-fashioned looking knits (with some flair, of course) so novelty yarn in general doesn&#8217;t work for me. also, as beautiful as mohair is, i&#8217;m not really attracted to its halo. 

## 15. What is/are your current knitting obsession/s?

oh, just knitting *at all* is my obsession. maybe i&#8217;m too new to have a sub-category obsession? <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" />

## 16. What is/are your favorite item/s to knit?

felted bags are fun and the felting process is forgiving of knitting errors, which is great. but i really like knitting things i get to wear &#8211; it&#8217;s so satisfying to pull something *on* that you *knit*. very cool.

## 17. What are you knitting right now?

just finished a sweater that is blocking as i type. so&#8230; nothing. right now, nothing.

## 18. What do you think about ponchos?

though i still vaguely plan on making a [paris loop][4], i&#8217;m not super interested in making a poncho, though i think they&#8217;re cute as a concept.

## 19. Do you prefer straight or circular needles?

circular &#8211; i just feel safer with them <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" />

## 20. Bamboo, aluminum, plastic?

bamboo. i like organic things.

## 21. Are you a sock knitter?

no, but i plan to be. <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" />

## 22. How did you learn to knit?

readings stitch n bitch and cursing a lot.

## 23. How old is your oldest UFO?

four months &#8211; it&#8217;s tasty from rowan&#8217;s r2 magazine. you can read about the disastrous-ness of my attempt [here][5].

## 24. What is your favorite animated character or a favorite animal/bird?

i love [nudibranchs][6], [always][7] [have][8]. cats are amazing. animated-wise&#8230; i loved the animaniacs when i was younger, and i still like animation now, but it&#8217;s a bit more grown up, like [when the wind blows][9], this incredible sweet and depressing story about an elderly british couple dealing with a nuclear winter. there&#8217;s also some incredible [russian cartoons][10] out there.. 

## 25. What is your favorite holiday?

christmas. i love it! it&#8217;s all about family, for me; they&#8217;re all on the east coast and i miss them terribly.

## 26. Is there anything that you collect? 

i&#8217;ve got a nice collection of pinecones, rocks, little &#8216;cholitos&#8217; from bolivia, and books, of course, always books.
