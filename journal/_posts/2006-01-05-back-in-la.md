<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="773" /></span>hi there ~ happy 2006! i got back yesterday morning and i *think* i&#8217;m finally caught up on sleep. now, today and tomorrow it&#8217;s all about clean up: pay old bills, return library books, organize papers, clean the apartment, return some gifts, etc etc. also, tomorrow i&#8217;m sending out some much overdue mail and little packages .. more on that later. <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> and then, on saturday, it&#8217;s back to the fiber! (there&#8217;s a spinning guild meeting, yay). 

i totally meant to post more in the last two weeks but family time is a total black hole, as much as i love them all!, and with five kids under the age of five, that black hole is just getting stronger. ha.

for christmas, i got a much needed ball winder that will work perfectly with this great wooden swift a friend surprised me with a few weeks ago &#8211; more on that later too. i&#8217;ve decided sometime next month i&#8217;m going to drive up to [carolina homespun][1] for the day and check out all their wheels. 2006 *will be* the year of the wheel! <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" />

ok, off to clean up and chill out ~ i can&#8217;t emphasize how happy i am to not have to go to work, to have days and days ahead of me with only schoolwork ahead and a very small and very flexible work schedule at ucla. bliss! 

hope everyone is happy and that the end of the year treated each and every one of you very well ~ 

p.s. my bloglines number is incredible.. over 500 entries to read!?!? craziness. also, that elephant pic is totally random, i know, but it&#8217;s what greeted us every day on the cruise ship after our room had been straightened up, isn&#8217;t it adorable! more pics later, gotta clear them with my family first &#8211; i may be all public, but they aren&#8217;t necessarily <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" />

update: at francesca&#8217;s request, here&#8217;s [the elephant pattern][2] from a [royal caribbean pamphlet][3] featuring lots of other animals. [this book][4] looks useful too. the librarian in me is feeling very smug right now. <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" />
