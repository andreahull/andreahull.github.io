&#8220;In 1890, when the government first tracked workers&#8217; hours, the average workweek for full-time manufacturing employees was 100 hours and 102 hours for building tradesmen.&#8221; ([link][1]) ~ i am very glad there is an 8 hour work day, aren&#8217;t you?

i love [may day][2], and since this year it also coincides with the beginning of the maryland sheep & wool festival, i took the day off, yay. i&#8217;m going to clean and organize a bit (yeah, 8 hours of pure recreation sounds great, but in reality it&#8217;s recreation + cleaning + cooking + etc etc, and that&#8217;s not even talking about if you&#8217;re a parent, and so on!), then get in the car and head on up to the fairgrounds. <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" />
