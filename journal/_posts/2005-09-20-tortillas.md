it started raining last night and it&#8217;s still all drip and splash outside my windows &#8211; i&#8217;m a moody girl, so i love moody weather, it just calms me right down. 

i thought i&#8217;d post some happy pictures of my first meal last night with my very own homemade tortillas &#8211; they were delicious!

you can find [tortilla presses][1] in all different sizes (and cheap!) you could theoretically make the [masa][2] (tortilla flour) yourself, but it seems like a pretty intensive effort. 

it really was amazing how different the tortillas tasted. i have this favorite local spot i love to get soft tacos from and i always assumed they had some delicious secret salsa or the combination of the limes and beans were doing it or *something* but the taste was always phenomenal. now i know where it&#8217;s really coming from &#8211; and i can re-create it myself whenever i want. heaven!

and for much prettier pictures and more tempting descriptions, read tigers & strawberries delicious accounts of [tortilla making][3]. i bookmarked the post and just kept reading it whenever i was hungry, it&#8217;s that good. 

i hope it keeps raining &#8211; it&#8217;s cheering me up. in knitting news, i finished the petit chou hipsters and am about half way through the top. so far so good. hope everyone is doing well &#8211; i&#8217;m off to eat some tacos <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> 

p.s. check [this][4] out &#8211; those italians are crazy! though now that i think about it, i *would* like to hike up [a 20 foot bunny][5].. i sound looney, but click the link, you&#8217;ll see what i mean. [via [absintheknits][6]]
