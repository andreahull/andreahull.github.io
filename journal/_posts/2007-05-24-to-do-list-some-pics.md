<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="1157" /></span>finally, a whole two days off! i&#8217;ve been really busy papermaking, and teaching papermaking, since sunday. when not sloshing around in water, i&#8217;m collapsed asleep on my bed. teaching kids is really exhausting! i shouldn&#8217;t have been so surprised, but i am &#8211; i get back at like six p.m. and by eight thirty max, am passed *out*. 

so, though it&#8217;s probably of little to no interest to any of you :), today and tomorrow is about my enormous to do list:  
~ <strike>set aside winter clothing for storage</strike>  
~ <strike>get rid of a lot of clothing</strike> [not a lot, but still ok]  
~ weed through books, sigh  
~ <strike>vacuum, sweep, generally clean floors in bed- and bathroom</strike>  
~ <strike>feed the horses + take veg. scraps to compost pile</strike><span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="1155" /></span>  
~ <strike>finish finn/mohair spinning + ply too</strike>  
~ <strike>figure out what yarn to destash</strike>

~ get the very last moving boxes out of the garage  
~ <strike>drink lots and lots of water</strike>

~ <strike>naps are not bad</strike>  
~ <strike>think about a new background for website</strike>

ok, that&#8217;s a very good list that there&#8217;s *no way* i&#8217;ll complete in two days, but i&#8217;ll give it a shot..

pictures: *some* of us, cough*mamacat*cough, are taking it easy today; my paper-encrusted feet this morning, the sign of a [sandal-wearing] papermaker; also from today, and though i look pretty pooped, my hair is getting so long! and i like seeming all freckly.
