~ [convert knitting patterns to fit gauge][1] [via [mj][2]]

~ the [new dove ad][3] is pretty facinating to watch. what do you think?

~ [this food timeline][4] is a bit overwhelming, but i can spend hours reading it. plus i dig the layout, so 1997. <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" />

~ of course, [the winter preview for interweave&#8217;s knits][5] is up. like most, i like the veronik avery, kate gilbert, nora gaughan, and eunny jang designs. so many cables and colorwork, definitely fun. i like the *idea* of the rambling rose cardigan, esp. the sleeves, but it&#8217;s a bit too tight all around and the colors too different.. closer shades and a looser fit could be quite nice.

~ the new itunes 7 has its&#8217; issues, but one giant plus is the ability [to backup and restore][6] the library as well as the playlists. finally! 

~ [this outfit][7] makes me wish my hair would grow faster already so i could [play with it more][8]

~ [good free photoshop tutorials][9], incl. removing a tan line, making a poster look old complete with stains, tears, and so on. 

~ silly but fun: [urban fairy doors][10], including a special project to [catch the fairies][11] conducted by a bunch of five year olds. aww. 

~ [the dog whisperer][12] is fascinating. i need to watch the dvds, these previews just aren&#8217;t enough.

~ i wish i could smell all [these scents][13]. though i pretty much have stuck to one scent for over ten years now, i like to try other stuff once in a while

~ have you seen jodi green&#8217;s [newest][14] [designs][15]? too cute. and though it&#8217;s been out for a while now, glampyre/stephanie japel&#8217;s [newest ][16] is beautiful as well.. though the price of that yarn?! crrazy. 

~ for those of you with old textbooks to sell, my sister told me about this site: [books into cash][17] where they pay for the books, including the shipping to send them 

~ [this spicy sweet potato soup is amazing][18]. 

~ the librarian in me loves [these types of discussions][19], &#8220;How should I organize my personal library?&#8221;

~ last week was a bad week. not only was there bogus columbus day, how about [world overshoot day][20]?

~ [earth wallpapers][21] for your desktop. i chose mauritania. 

happy tuesday to you all. i&#8217;m off to ucla to pick up my last paycheck and take some pics around town, but first some music and some cat petting. ~ ~
