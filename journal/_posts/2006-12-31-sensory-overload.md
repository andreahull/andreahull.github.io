that&#8217;s the [earth guild][1] store in asheville, nc. amazing stuff. i got a couple of spin-offs, some flax (for my new distaff, yay), two basketry kits (double yay), a folkwear pattern (the [russian dress][2]), and a basketry book. &#8230;.oof, there&#8217;s no end to the things i want to learn. 

(besides the craftsy stuff, there&#8217;s people too: my mom&#8217;s exclaiming about the hand-painted silk, my dad, in a blue sweater, is patiently waiting, and i&#8217;m trying to disguise my camera-shyness by touching some lovely linen samples.)
