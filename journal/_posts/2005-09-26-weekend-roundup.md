hi there ~ <span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="690" /></span>

my little sisters always tell me it&#8217;s takes 21 days for something to become a pattern. i&#8217;m hoping that&#8217;s not true &#8211; or at least it&#8217;s a pattern easily broken. september has largely sucked. bring on october already. `</moan>`

moving right along: some pics.. first off, a delicious mango cake that i, happily, still have one piece left of and plan to eat tomorrow night as a late night snack. this past thursday, my cousin, his mother, and a close friend of theirs, met me for dinner at a delicious nearby [oaxacan restaurant][1] and then dessert at my place, hence the delicious mango cake you see here. 

it was such a nice time &#8211; a cousin i don&#8217;t see very often but when we do, we talk our heads off, at least since we&#8217;ve been adults (when we were kids we were both pretty shy around each other if i remember right..) <span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="691" /></span>very fun. *and* he reads my ramblings here. (hello!) how cool is that. i need more cousins like him. <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" />

then, my new knitting project (i finished mon petit chou &#8211; not without some difficulties &#8211; both the bottom and top. i&#8217;ll post pics, just as soon as i figure out how much flesh i want to show on these here internets.) .. the cute cables-and-lace, how could i resist!, top from this summer&#8217;s vogue knitting. 

i&#8217;m using an all acrylic yarn that i got for practically a song and let me just say, it&#8217;s the sproingiest softest acrylic i&#8217;ve ever felt. i&#8217;m almost done with the back, but the ribbing is a little hard on my hands, so this will probably take a few weeks. 

these <span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="689" /></span>last pics are of my very sweet trouble cat. i tried this weekend to take some good pics of her &#8211; i wanted to put her on my [home page][2] for a while, since mama cat&#8217;s been there for at least a year. 

i got [a good one][2] i&#8217;m happy with for now, but i had to share these others since trouble just cracks me up. in the first pic, she&#8217;s all shy and timid, since i had just bust out the camera. then she starts getting a little annoyed &#8211; see the ears? i love those ears, i could just eat them up. and then we move on to the direct phase where she just looks me right in the eye as in &#8220;*what* do you want.&#8221; 

when i first got trouble, along with her sister mellow and mama cat, she was like the &#8216;normal&#8217; cat and thus didn&#8217;t get much notice from me for a while. soon enough though, her weird ways shined through, and i love her so for them. <span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="687" /></span>i &#8216;cat talk&#8217; with her all the time &#8211; it&#8217;s where i stare at her and then slowly blink my eyes, or just one and then the other, and then flick my head to one side, very meaningful-like, and, believe me, she *gets* it, totally does. 

and in other news, well, in bad news: i got a parking ticket on saturday. normally there aren&#8217;t any parking restrictions on the weekend, but come saturday morning, of course, only *then* did i see the temporary &#8220;no parking&#8221; sign that i could almost swear was *not* up the day before. turns out there was a big street fair/festival a few blocks away. i was majorly pissed off at myself *and* at the city. *why* that street, and all parallel street for many blocks in either direction, had to be closed off was totally mysterious. during the whole festival, no one went on those blocked-off streets, no vendors, no dancers, no tourists, nobody. argghhh. very frustrating.

so, september is almost over &#8211; what&#8217;s coming up next?<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="688" /></span> a cousin is to visit me &#8211; i&#8217;m holding a brand new 12&#8221; powerbook and blue mini ipod hostage so she *has* to come, school starts next week, i&#8217;m applying for a second job (only 10 hours a week, cross your fingers for me), and i&#8217;m determined to spend more time moving my body in the natural world, i.e. head to the newly-discovered-park-right-next-to-a-library during lunch on a regular basis and diligently do excercise three or four times a week in the morning.

that&#8217;s it for now ~ have a great monday.

p.s. mj [linked the other day][3] to an [incredibly horrendous peta video condeming fur][4]. i&#8217;m doing the same linking &#8211; animals are ever-loving sweet living gorgeous beings and we treat them largely, as a whole, like utter crap. i wish the whole video had focused more on animal cruelty being committed in the u.s. than in asia, as it did in the beginning of the video. &#8220;Sixty-four percent of fur farms are in Northern Europe, 11 percent are in North America&#8221;, [right?][5] so why focus so much on china?
