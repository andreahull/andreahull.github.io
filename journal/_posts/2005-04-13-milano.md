hello there&#8212;i&#8217;m in milano right now waiting for my flight to palermo&#8230; i&#8217;m typing on this weird keyboard that&#8217;s literally jus plastic with little key-squares printed on it, very unsatisying to type on besides being really hard to get legible words out on&#8230;. but no complaints here, i&#8217;m in friggin&#8217; italy! <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" />

it&#8217;s so foggy here in milan but in palermo it should be a bit more like california weather, with spring out in full-force&#8230; i hope so at least, since i brought bascially only spring clothing. 

i&#8217;d forgotten how sicily in general, and palermo in paticular, is put down often by many italians, particularly those from the north. when i was passing through customs, the customs guy started laughing about how i was going to sicily and how wouldn&#8217;t i rather go to florence or stay in milan. ha, as if. as you all will see&#8212;when find a computer that will recognize my camera&#8212;sicily is gorgeous and palermo even more so.

ok, time&#8217;s up&#8212;have a great day everyone!
