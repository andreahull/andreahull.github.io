<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="314" /></span>i&#8217;ve been thinking about this for a bunch of days now, and it certainly shouldn&#8217;t come as any surprise: i want a wheel. real bad.

i don&#8217;t feel right buying one right now &#8211; i&#8217;m too disorganized and anyway, august is going to be so busy, i won&#8217;t have a lot of time to spin then, so i&#8217;ve come up with good solid three pre-requisites before i can buy a wheel.

1) try out at least *five* different wheels. so far i&#8217;ve spun on:

  * ~ ashford kiwi. verdict: not crazy about it, it&#8217;s just ok
  * ~ asford traveller. verdict: immediate &#8216;ahhh&#8217; the second i tried it

<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="315" /></span>i really want to try out a [majacraft][1], a [kromski][2], a [louet][3], and a [lendrum][4] (thanks [deb][5]). i&#8217;m not really interested visually in a louet, but people seem to love them. i think i prefer [castle wheels to saxony wheels][6], plus space is definitely an issue. i haven&#8217;t tried otherwise, but i&#8217;m digging the double treadle, single drive wheels. with that said, any suggestions/tips on buying a wheel from you spinners out there?

2) get rid of stuff. i have wayyy too much stuff &#8211; and as i mention all the time, my apartment is teeny, so the packrat in me shudders, but i intend on selling/donating some of the following:

  * ~ clothing 
  * ~ [books][7]<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="316" /></span>  
    &#8211; ack, hard to do, but i have lots of textbooks so..</p> 
      * ~ stereo &#8211; don&#8217;t need it, thanks to my mac
      * ~ fabric stash &#8211; totally un-necessary since i don&#8217;t like to sew much at all, i&#8217;ve realized
      * ~ food stash &#8211; yeah, all those canned beans and pineapple slices i&#8217;ve had for a good year, i need to *clear them out*</ul> 
    and the real kicker:
    
    3) no fines whatsoever for 60 days. this includes:
    
      * ~ library fines
      * ~ atm and overcharge fees<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="317" /></span>
      * ~ parking tickets
    
    i&#8217;m horribly bad at getting fines. i was doing some budgeting last week &#8211; ack! horrible! hated it! &#8211; and i saw that 8% of my income in june went to fines. 8!! ay&#8230;. so. i decided if i *do* get a fine, i can&#8217;t get a wheel till 60 days from that day. hopefully this will help me get a grip on fines, cause i&#8217;m obviously out of control with them, yikes.
    
    ah, and that&#8217;s the list. i feel good about it &#8211; a *spinning wheel* is most definitely a worthy prize to look forward to.
    
    p.s. the top pic shows the results of my handspinning for two weeks. i&#8217;m knitting up a scarf (merino &#8211; in this weather! crrrazy) using [this][8] stitch. also, i&#8217;ve started a journal detailing my handspinning progress for all the various yarns i made. the close-up pic shows some olive merino that was pretty evenly spun, yay. the last pic is the best of my handspinning -it&#8217;s [superwash][9] corriedale, only four oz., and i got two skeins of a little more than 120 yards each, plus a smaller skein of 30 yards or so (gotta figure out how to ply all the way through bobbins at one stretch), and a teeny skein of singles and some [navajo-ply][10] that i tried out. the yarn is totally [balanced][11] (hoorah!) and so super soft, i love it.
