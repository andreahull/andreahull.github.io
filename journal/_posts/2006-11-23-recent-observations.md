~ i&#8217;m the [tenth listing][1] for tofurky on google image. <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> had it two years ago tomorrow &#8211; it was a very tasty meal and i have really sweet memories from the dinner to boot. btw, that&#8217;s a (delicious) quiche pictured with it, not pizza. 

~ it&#8217;s been raining non-stop today and looks to be the same tomorrow. i drove around in a pickup with the rear cloth cover flapping and snapping in the wind. l.a. was depressing with all its homeless animals scrounging for food, dodging cars, and hopefully following a random stranger once in a while, but i forgot how sad it can be here, seeing all the dead deer, raccoons, fox, and more on side of the streets. it&#8217;s a scary time for animals on the edge of rural/suburban maryland. 

~ my nephew is so much less old-man looking just a week after being born. and his sisters are shooting up as well in just the few weeks i&#8217;ve been here &#8211; is that possible? they&#8217;re growing up so fast, sniff.<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="1008" /></span>

~ no matter what, moving from living alone to living with people definitely required an adjustment. i leave notes now, talk on the phone *much* more than i used to, and generally consult others every day at least a few times. i remember entire days in l.a. &#8211; some very happy, some very not &#8211; where i wouldn&#8217;t say a single word to anyone so much so that when i spoke, my voice would be squeaky and/or i&#8217;d surprise myself hearing a voice. now, throw in the whole family/living with the parents/etc thing, and it just adds more, um, spice.

~ i miss you l.a.! i don&#8217;t know when i&#8217;ll stop believing in my gut, in my heart, in my dreams, that my apartment is no longer mine. <span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="1007" /></span>maybe if i saw it empty, that would be different. i still feel very much like a visitor, on a looong vacation. when i came back from an exchange student program to sicily in high school, i remember closing my eyes over and over again and remembering the details of the shower/tub i&#8217;d had there, so perfectly that i could almost reach my hand out and touch the walls. for years, that&#8217;s been my trick, through college and on &#8211; for some reason, it&#8217;s connected to showers <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> anyhow, i keep doing that now, imagining opening my eyes and seeing the green curtain covering the window, the see-through shower curtain with trouble sitting just beyond, staring, fascinated by my water immersion. the water pressure in my l.a. shower was *phenomenal*. too much to miss that still feels more real than my life now. 

<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="1006" /></span>~ i&#8217;m laughing a lot with my mom &#8211; somewhat unexpected and very very enjoyable. my sister claudi is visiting for all of twenty hours, so it&#8217;s an early wake-up tomorrow to maximize hang out time, combined with big cooking responsibilities. i&#8217;m making deborah madison&#8217;s winter squash tart &#8211; and am nervous about the crust. 

~ oh, and thanksgiving itself? [still not a fan][2]. i like the food, i like the family ;), i have a lot to be thankful for, but the whole prilgrims-and-indians thing? [untrue][3] & [depressing.][4] 

so much more to post ~ but for now, there&#8217;s what been going on with me. hope you have a relaxing and delicious day tomorrow, filled with good food and good company.
