<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="160" /></span>feeling rather safe that my sister won&#8217;t see this (and if you *do*, bella, just don&#8217;t tell me, ok?) i have a broad knitting question to ask: what should i knit for my three brand-new nieces/nephews? 

(my sister daniella and her husband john adopted a baby early november &#8211; and on that same day my sister found out she was pregnant with twins. (!))

anyhow, back when i only knew about kiyra, the baby that was   
adopted (my sister didn&#8217;t tell us about the twins till christmas day when we all promptly freaked out), i started [these][1] <span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail id="162" /></span>&#8212; some beautiful baby booties from a debbie bliss pattern (go [amanda][2] for recognizing what it was!) but i have yet to seam up them up

what to knit for these other two? and should i still plan on these booties for kiyra, or should i make her something else? and i&#8217;d really like to knit something for my sister &#8212; her birthday&#8217;s in june and i&#8217;ve always been really really bad at getting her gifts whereas she&#8217;s the type that will give *other people* gifts on *her* birthday. (crrazy sweet, isn&#8217;t she?) i want something pregnant-appropriate but can&#8217;t figure out what. i&#8217;ve put erika knight&#8217;s [knitting for two][3] on hold at the library, but it&#8217;ll be weeks before i get it.

(btw, this is all in lieu of posting pictures of my topsecret sweater &#8212; i have two inches to go on the turtleneck part and i left my 11&#8221; circs at home, darn.)
