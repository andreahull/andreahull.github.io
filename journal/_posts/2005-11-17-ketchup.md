two of my favorite jokes ever, proving the forever immaturity of my mind:

~ what&#8217;s the color of a burp? burple.  
~ where do generals keep their armies? up their sleevies. 

here&#8217;s <strike>some</strike> one photo for now, showing my mad spinning skillz, while i indeed play catchup to work, school, swap knitting, emails, laundry, and the such &#8211; i started thinking what pics to post and man, there&#8217;s too many. tomorrow for sure for sure i&#8217;m returning the wheel, so i figure i&#8217;ll do some last spinning tonight, and i&#8217;ll post a whole slew of pics this weekend. for now, this one sums up how i feel about my handspuns, and yes that entire basket is filled with them.

too many good links out there:

~ [ten dollar sale for threadless tees][1], very tempting.  
~ i&#8217;m determined to finally this year go to l.a.&#8217;s own [bazaar bizarre][2]..  
~ especially now that i know [jill bliss][3] will be there. i love her stuff, and i&#8217;m liking a lot her [new 2006 calendar][4] (can you believe it&#8217;s time to already be thinking about 2006 calendars!?)  
~ one day, i too will have [a secret room][5] [via [absinthe knits][6]]  
~ for you book and techie lovers, check out the [internet archive][7]&#8217;s new [open library][8], very very cool. try [turning the page][9] &#8211; it uses [AJAX][10] (for coding, not cleaning) to make it look so purty. 

and lastly, a question regarding hair color: (more of the) blonde or platinum?
