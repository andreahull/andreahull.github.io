finished: january 24, 2006  
pattern: flentent hat kit from [bea ellis knitwear][1]  
yarn: 2 balls of dale heilo, and about half a ball of cotton yarn for the lining

the flenten hat was so much fun to knit! i finished all but the pom part back in december but in the holiday-craziness couldn&#8217;t figure out whether or not i wanted poms or not. in the end, i went for fun. 

since my head is um big, this hat is a bit too snug so i&#8217;ll pass it on to someone else one day. no biggie though, that just means i&#8217;ll have to knit more of these.

this was my first fair isle try, thanks to [mj][2]&#8217;s [norwegian knit along][3], and it is as addicting as cabling and lace &#8211; and the colors, wow! bright, huh? love it! 

i&#8217;m pretty happy with the tension. i didn&#8217;t bother blocking this hat but i&#8217;m sure that could only help, so i may do that later on. i didn&#8217;t understand how stranding worked so next time, i&#8217;ll pick whatever i want to pop and strang that underneath the other color. 

the one thing i&#8217;m not happy about is the lining, where it joins the hat &#8211; man it looks ugly! next time i&#8217;ll use a crochet provisional cast-on, then unravel the chain and knit the live stitches with the next row, which if you see mj&#8217;s hat linings, are muuuuch nicer looking.

this was a fast knit and i&#8217;ll definitely be making more of these!
