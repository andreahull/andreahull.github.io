<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="1150" /></span>this last month, or two even, i&#8217;ve been posting so much less than i&#8217;ve meant to.. it&#8217;s been super busy. i&#8217;ve been wondering about personal vs. crafty posting yet again. computer issues. camera issues. and now the list of things i have to catch up on posting-wise is getting a tad too scary-long. so, i figure i just gotta sit down, stop worrying & just write. and to make it even easier, bullet points &#8211; or, as i prefer, tildes <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> :

~ i&#8217;m the new associate papermaker [here][1]. you say, &#8220;i never knew you made paper, andrea!&#8221;, and i reply, you are right, i&#8217;ve made paper twice. but: i&#8217;m a quick learner, i have lotttts of book history and conservation and all that other good stuff crammed into my brain from library school, i find papermaking fascinating stuff and it fits so perfectly with the bookmaking i&#8217;ve done on the side + the letterpress and stamping, .. and so that&#8217;s that. i&#8217;m still a little surprised by it all too, but very excited. plus, it&#8217;s the perfect excuse to stock up on rainboots. <span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="1149" /></span>

~ i almost got my own letterpress press two weeks ago. it was close enough to being mine that i now have a space all cleaned up and ready, a floor plan planned out for a little printshop, and a strong & burning desire to have my own press. it *will* happen, just not this month. since my parents have the space, and it&#8217;s nice to stretch out after living in a teeny single for so long, i&#8217;m looking at the [big chandler & price presses][2] from the early 1900s. sigh. so pretty, aren&#8217;t they?

~ i went to the md. sheep and wool festival, hung out with both [knitbuddies][3], brought home a bunch of natural dyes and three, count &#8216;em!, *three* fleeces. yup. three. i bought relatively small fleeces, all under five pounds, so there&#8217;s &#8216;only&#8217; eleven pounds of fleece. washed, that&#8217;ll be more like seven or eight. i hope. still, love the fleece. think i&#8217;m crazy? ya gotta see them in person to believe it. plus there&#8217;s a story behind one, gotta remember to tell you it later.<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="1151" /></span>

~ my mom has been very patient about the general fleece stinkiness, mamcat likes to roll around in them when no one&#8217;s looking, but trouble peed on one of the bags (no harm was done to the fleece, thank goodness for her!) so i think her delicate nose agrees with my mom. other than that, the cats are good, *really* good even. makes me happy to see my little family good like that. 

~ [mg][3] stayed with me for a couple of days after the festival and we had a great time. plus, she got me to take the plunge and frog the lice sweater i was all antsy about months ago. *and* she got me to start knitting again&#8230; [rogue][4], of all things! but, i got her to buy a flicker brush *and* sent her home with a little bag stuffed with bits of fleece. fair&#8217;s fair, huh.<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="1148" /></span>

~ i&#8217;ve been singing a lot to the radio lately. and just by myself too. i don&#8217;t have a good voice, but i&#8217;m a pretty enthusiastic singer. i&#8217;ve been doing a lot of driving these past two weeks and have had to turn the music off to be able to plan out *anything* because the singing bug&#8217;s been in me so much lately. 

ok, that&#8217;s good for now. it&#8217;s been a pretty great two weeks, but i&#8217;m still catching up on sleep &#8211; last two nights, i feel asleep before eleven! that&#8217;s crazy early for me. anyhow, here&#8217;s a bunch of pics too. hope may has been treating you all real good.
