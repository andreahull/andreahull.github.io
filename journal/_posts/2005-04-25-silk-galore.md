hello all ~ 

<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="222" /></span>april has flown by but i can&#8217;t say i&#8217;m not looking forward to the end of it .. there&#8217;s nothing planned for may and i&#8217;m so relieved. i love traveling and seeing friends and family, but i&#8217;m at heart a solitude-seeking person, so may oh may, i can&#8217;t wait till you come and normal life returns. and normal life is pretty great, i must say, as evidenced by these two pics:

this first photo shows the latest from my secret pal.. three, count &#8216;em three!, skeins of lovely lovely reynolds&#8217; [mandalay][1] in a gee-orgeous color that is so up my alley. did i mention the yarn is 100% silk and has the most beautiful texture, both for the eye and the hand?! thank you so so much secret pal! i see a tank in my future, something lacey and feminine &#8212; i love this yarn!

<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="221" /></span>the second is my [branching out][2] scarf which i started last night, catching up on some tv shows (they were *just* what i needed last night, the first night i had the place to myself in over two weeks: gilmore girls, desperate housewives, america&#8217;s top model). i love lace, what can i say. and the yarn is truly lovely, a silk/wool blend that just shines. and since the pattern calls for just one skein, who can&#8217;t help but love a $7 silky warm lace scarf? not me.

lastly, i&#8217;m finally get organazized, as my sisters says, and so for lunch i&#8217;m off to the post office, to finally send off that last secret pal package as well as a few other long-promised goodies (i&#8217;m looking at you, [liz][3]..), as well as pick up a mystery package that&#8217;s been waiting patiently for a few days &#8212; yay!
