## by Mette Ivie Harrison

a quick read (i&#8217;m starting to realize that&#8217;s a pattern for me.. is that good or bad?), this is also a good story. as much as i enjoy re-tellings of fairy tales, i realized tonight that i&#8217;ve gotten used to those authors who do most of them and, as good as (most of them) are, all their stories start to sound the same, have the same atmosphere, phrasing, etc.

well, not this one. it&#8217;s much darker for one. though a little too preachy at times, this book really stands out. the writing isn&#8217;t as beautiful &#8211; nor is it trying to be.
