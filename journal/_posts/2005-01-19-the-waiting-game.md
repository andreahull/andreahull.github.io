title: the waiting game
layout: post
---

it&#8217;s been a busy and pretty happy four days ~ but now i&#8217;m waiting impatiently for several projects to start and meanwhile my mind&#8217;s spinning with what i need to do and my body is protesting with all the prolonged sleep deprivation. silly i know to not get enough sleep, but there&#8217;s just too much i want to do, and really work and school is the least of it.

anyhow, what am i waiting for? 

~ [secret pals 4][1] (which will being roughly around the beginning of february.)

~ [a new release of textpattern][2], my lovely cms/blogging application (once that&#8217;s up and running, i promise to work on the long-neglected [projects][3] page.)

~ [the new interweave knits][4] magazine (the [annie modesitt][5] dolman is beautiful!)

~ i finally caved and joined [crafters choice][6] &#8211; basically a book club for craftsy folk. most of the books offered are duds, in my opinion, but the deal to sign up &#8211; 4 books for $1 each &#8211; was too good to pass once i saw the few but great knitting books they have. so, on their way to me are the following: [knitting in the old way][7], [simply felt][8], [simple knits with a twist][9], [the knitter&#8217;s book of finishing techniques][10], [stitch n&#8217; bitch nation][11], and [felted knits][12]. yes, 6 books for less than $38, including shipping! 

~ according to ups tracking, on friday i&#8217;ll get some nice cheap (and hopefully very soft) yarn to make my own [top secret][13]. still deciding on the whole turtleneck part of it, but the idea of knitting it in the round with very little seaming to do, yay!

~ (everybody&#8217;s working for) the weekend (duh. yes, i had a three day weekend last week but already i&#8217;m counting the days till friday. not a good job sign, i know. sigh.)

in the meantime, i&#8217;ve been organizing my apartment, getting rid of clothing i haven&#8217;t worn in years or even months, knitting like a mad woman, chatting all nights on forums online (yes, i&#8217;m a dork), and watching so many movies my head spins just thinking about it: pennies from heaven (loved the music!), woman of the year (ugh, so very dated), private benjamin (not as good as i remembered), enchanted april (remembered belatedly that i had already seen it but was happy to re-watch anyhow), and [control room][14] (very good, as expected). 

the weather here has turned typical-southern-california-like, which means short skirts and flip-flops, and while that *is* relief from all those rainy days, still, fickle me, i&#8217;m already missing the rain.
