help a girl out &#8211; a, b, or c? 

i&#8217;ve finished both of the front panels and the back in a fit of knitting madness today (and look ma! my hands don&#8217;t hurt, yeehaw). i definitely don&#8217;t have enough yarn for the full length, but that&#8217;s fine since i&#8217;m not overly fond of the long sleeves here anyhow. 

so, what&#8217;s it to be?

p.s. i had to cut off the model&#8217;s head in the pics &#8211; a little too early madonna for me. not that madonna couldn&#8217;t pull it off, but a rowan model? oh yeah, she&#8217;s sass personified.
