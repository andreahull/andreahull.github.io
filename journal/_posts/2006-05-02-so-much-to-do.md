i&#8217;m going to be posting a lot this week, i&#8217;m thinking. there&#8217;s just too much going on. so, for now, a quick recap of my awesome weekend and some links. 

i went on a fiber retreat and this is what i brought back:  
1) a felt hat (!) that needs some stiffening for the brim, some grosgrain ribbon on the inside as well, and maybe some bias tape on the rim to prettify the edges.*   
2) two bobbins full of yarn-to-be-plied using [janel][1]&#8217;s lovely roving (colorway &#8220;leaf peepers&#8221;)  
3) sunburn &#8211; on arms (hello, farmer tan!), nose, and scalp

there was a lot of laughing and talking with some fabulous women, good food, and incredible views. see [francesca][2]&#8217;s post for pics and such. a great time was had and it all passed way too quickly.

oh and yes, that&#8217;s my new hair. brown! with some reds, that you can&#8217;t see. and some blondes on the top, always fun. a [smorgasboard][3] of color. better pics later. 

[meow girl][4] just posted about the same thing, though her husband did it a bit more cleverly. i just bought mine, and it&#8217;s clay, not real eggshell, but here&#8217;s my newly sprouting basil. isn&#8217;t it too cute? it inspired me to buy some other herb plants and seeds, though pics for that will have to wait. 

now, some links:

~ have you seen stephen colbert&#8217;s speech at the [white house correspondents&#8217; dinner][5]? it&#8217;s great and funny as can be. i love how the camera stopped swinging over to bush to capture his reactions after a bit, ha. 

~ i don&#8217;t have a microwave, and though at times i miss popcorn-in-45-seconds and all that, in general, i feel happy not to have one in my home. here&#8217;s another good reason: check out what this science experiment showed when a little girl watered two plants, one with stove-boilded water, the other with water that was microwaved.

~ [make your own salt][8]! wow. [also via ptf]

~ the eat local challenge people started [a book club][9], so especially for those of you who can&#8217;t participate belly-wise this month (and believe me, i understand, it&#8217;s going to be hard at times for me, i know already!), how about [head-wise][10]? (oh the new words i make up. don&#8217;t groan!) 

i&#8217;m busy busy in my knitting &#8211; and anxiously awaiting some deliveries, yay. *love* getting mail. i&#8217;m about 60% done with madli shawl &#8211; 20 out of 31 repeats done, so with about a repeat a day, i should be done in the next two weeks. 

tomorrow i&#8217;ll post my answers to the the [eat local challenge][11] questionnaire as well as some happy photos of local produce. bye!
