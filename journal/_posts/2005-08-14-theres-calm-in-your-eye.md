i don&#8217;t know where i&#8217;ll be a year from now. i really have no clue &#8211; i&#8217;m already at a stage i never dreamed i&#8217;d be in when i was little. i never ever thought i&#8217;d be living in california, much less in l.a. for five years. that i&#8217;d be twenty-eight and living alone. that i could get so caught up in and love creating things with my hands. that i wouldn&#8217;t be a republican. that i&#8217;d never be taller than 5&#8217;3&#8221;.

some things haven&#8217;t changed though &#8211; i knew i&#8217;d always love books, cats, dancing in my room, the way my hair looks underwater like i&#8217;m a mermaid. that i&#8217;d love my family forever. that i love to be sassy and sparkly with boys that catch my eye. that i always slow down at the end of big projects. that i&#8217;m a big ol&#8217; cry-baby. 

here&#8217;s another thing that i knew would be and i still know *will be* in my future, which makes me very happy, and which i wanted to share with all you nice people: one day, i&#8217;m going to live in a house that i built myself. and it&#8217;s going to look something like this..

<div style="text-align: center; border: 1px dotted silver; padding-top: 11px; margin: 7px;">
  <txp:jmr_gallery category="343" />
</div>

and once it was built, i&#8217;d invite friends over for long stays and i&#8217;d knit and read by the fireside with my cats and i&#8217;d trudge in the snow and look for hawks and sleep in a comfy fluffy bed. i&#8217;m ok with where i am now &#8211; and often much better than ok &#8211; but sometimes, to try and get to sleep, instead of counting sheep, i plan out my dream house. 

what does your dream house look like?
