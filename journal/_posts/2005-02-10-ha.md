the other day, i [briefly posted][1] about being infuriated about something. that something was the story on this &#8216;reporter&#8217; who had had two years worth of daily press passes to the white house and who was known for throwing major lobs question-wise to bush&#8217;s people, particularly right after some &#8216;embarassing&#8217; questioning by other journalists. 

the thing that raised people&#8217;s suspicions was that this guy wasn&#8217;t a reporter for anything actually in print, but rather a website that was funded, it came out, by gop folks. furthermore, he was operating under a pseudonym (and white house security was ok with that? hm). 

well, it looks like [that][2] [cover][3] [has][4] [been][5] [blown][6].

(and i agree with [michaelmoore.com][7], &#8220;Don&#8217;t let anyone throw you any softballs&#8230; the Jeff Gannon scandal is about more than [some gay websites][8].&#8221;)

p.s. in completely other news, [this][9] article, esepcially the first sentence, is making my mouse-clicking finger twitch &#8212; must resist [knitpicks][10], must resist.
