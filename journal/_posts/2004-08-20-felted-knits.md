## by Beverly Galeskas 

with beautiful timeless projects ranging from slippers to pillowcases to bags, galeskas gently introduces the long-honored tradition of felting. with clear and concise language, and smart use of images, tis book will help anyone make their first felted project. additionally, i can totally agree with the author&#8217;s note that the vast majority of these patterns were created with the beginner knitter in mind. 

for those who already have felted, this book is still a great resource not only in describing in detail what actually happens during felting but also has a handy list of recommended yarns and companies.

[btw, this was the first book i used to follow my first pattern to create my first real knitted project (i&#8217;m totally ignoring that long skinny bulky thing i made a few weeks before that &#8211; it felt ridiculous to be making as it was 90 degrees in l.a. and i was knitting a friggin&#8217; 100% wool scarf! ay.) &#8211; to see the results of said project, check [this][1] out.]
