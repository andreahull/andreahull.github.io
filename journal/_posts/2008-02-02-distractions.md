see, i *have* been knitting. i&#8217;ve just run into a few problems with my various projects. for example:  
<span class="pic3"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="1268" /></span>  
any suggestions on getting an ink stain out? i&#8217;ve tried acetone, water, oxy clean &#8211; i&#8217;m thinking about double stitching over the ink but the new stitches would be pretty darn obvious. or not? help! 

in the meantime, some welcome distractions: spinning with my nieces and nephew. nothing like a spinning wheel to make three year olds (and two year olds, and a fourteen month old) curious. kiyra, the oldest, has declared she wants a spinning wheel for her birthday.

thanks for the sweet comments and emails from my last post ~ ~ you all rock. i got back from bolivia on monday and i&#8217;m slowly catching up on laundry, emptying suitcases, emails, and organizing photos from my trip. so, don&#8217;t worry, there&#8217;s a good handful of bolivia-related posts coming up. 

happy groundhog day ~
