hello!

busy busy on everything as usual & hatching little plans & daydreaming & also updating the look of this site a bit..

[run luci run!][1]

&#8221;&#8230;But we&#8217;re a bunch of raw material[s] that don&#8217;t mean to have any process upon us, don&#8217;t mean to be made into any product, don&#8217;t mean to end up being bought by some clients of the University, be they the government, be they industry, be they organized labor, be they anyone! We&#8217;re human beings! 

There is a time when the operation of the machine becomes so odious, makes you so sick at heart, that you can&#8217;t take part; you can&#8217;t even passively take part, and you&#8217;ve got to put your bodies upon the gears and upon the wheels, upon the levers, upon all the apparatus, and you&#8217;ve got to make it stop. And you&#8217;ve got to indicate to the people who run it, to the people who own it, that unless you&#8217;re free, the machine will be prevented from working at all! 

Now, no more talking. We&#8217;re going to march in singing &#8220;We Shall Overcome.&#8221; Slowly; there are a lot of us. Up here to the left&#8212;I didn&#8217;t mean the pun.&#8221;
