it was filled &#8211; just filled to the brim. there were a few key things missing, but still, i feel terribly lucky to have such good friends and to continue to meet and get to know better super interesting people. <span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="896" /></span>ah, i love l.a.. pretty soon after i first moved out here &#8211; six years ago this summer &#8211; i was riding the buses all over the place and really got to know the city. now, it&#8217;s like deja vu all over again, as yogi berra says. my farewell tour. (the drama!)

saturday i hung out with [francesca][1], my spinning guild buddy. she&#8217;s awesome. we went over to little tokyo, shopped around kinokuniya and both picked up some craftsy books, then hit the small but [delicious][2] (and very nicely priced) [famer&#8217;s market][3] that&#8217;s open in the plaza-area on saturdays. after that, we went back to her place and conducted a photo and video shoot for her unique [tubular cast-on][4] that uses no waste yarn &#8211; it&#8217;s fabulous! take a look at her tutorial, with images, pics, and video, she makes it easy to understand what&#8217;s going on. 

on sunday, i headed over to [knit cafe][5] and hung out with [julia][6], who i&#8217;d only met once before, but it was just pretty obvious that we had just hit it off, yay. <span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="897" /></span>anyhow, again, so cool to see her and chat. i met a bunch of other [nice][7] [ladies][8] (hi!) as well. i finally picked up the summer IK and as soon as i saw the [icarus shawl][9], i had to find me some laceweight. julia convinced me to get the prettiest grey that has overtones (undertones? whatever) of green. i think it&#8217;ll turn out great, hurrah.

but. in the meantime, check out my [deciduous top][10] &#8211; so much fun to knit, though some of my stitches are wonky right now, hm. plus, i finally get the whole calmer obsession, that yarn truly is a joy to knit with. anyhow, can&#8217;t wait to try it on. i&#8217;ve been missing my knitting mojo, but it&#8217;s back in full force it seems.

<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="898" /></span>ok, so then sunday afternoon/night, a birthday party at my friend&#8217;s home in highland park &#8211; she rented a moon bounce and there was also a water balloon fight, plus delicious korean food galore. excellent. a question: what do you call a moon bounce? is it just an east coast thing to call it that, or just an andrea thing? everyone there was laughing at me, because they called it a &#8220;jumper&#8221; or &#8220;bouncer&#8221;, then when i probed a bit, they admitted it could be also called a &#8220;bouncy castle&#8221;, &#8220;bounce house&#8221;, and a few other bizarre terms. is it like the whole regional soda versus pop thing? hmm. so important, you *do* realize. ha!

<span class="picl"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="900" /></span>all in all, a satisfying weekend<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="901" /></span>- with lots of boring reality (i.e. putting my whole kitchen back together) and sadness (i.e. blasting music, sighing and pacing around my room) thrown in to make it more real. i like it that way, i don&#8217;t trust those perfect weekends.

hope yours was equally satisfying ~ ~ 

p.s. oh yeah, finally i got up my madli&#8217;s shawl pics and [project info][11] &#8211; i finished it in may (!) and have been using it practically non-stop at work and on airplanes. i&#8217;m looking pretty unhappy in that foto to the right, but it was taken in may, when i was in fact fairly unhappy. so glad it&#8217;s july and not may anymore.
