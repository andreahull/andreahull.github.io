..amidst all the hustle and bustle of these last days of the year, i made some time this morning to stop and remember little moments like these.

*these* are the &#8220;yes!&#8221; moments that make up for every &#8220;no no no&#8221; in life. so, a big breath, a happy sigh, and then off we go again ~ ~
