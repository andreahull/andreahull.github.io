no, nothing interesting to see here right now, keep moving, folks.

there&#8217;s a definite method to my madness when it comes to the all-too-familiar major procrastination before a final paper is due. (how major? 16 pages minimum due in 18 hours. zero done so far. ah. let&#8217;s let that sink in for a moment. .. yup.) 

so. first, i determine i need an empty canvas to create so i clean, both myself and my environment.

next, thinking i need to feel relaxed and not stressed, i read silly books and leaf through magazines (in this case, searching for the best prettiest greatest pattern of all time for my next starteritis-crushing project). 

then, i decide a &#8216;power nap&#8217; is a good idea to get really ready for the surge of creativity on which i will soon embark. i toss and turn and feel guilty the whole time.

finally, i just sit on my couch or sprawl on my bed staring into nothing, moodily nodding now and then and feeling like i&#8217;m being lectured to even though my mother and other authority figures are far away. 

of course, while this whole pattern plays itself out, i am short-tempered with my cats, neurotic with my friends, and a giant shirker of job responsibilities.

although after all this, i usually do write the papers, every once in a while i just *can&#8217;t* get it together and i simply do not turn *anything* in. thus, i got my first D in 5th grade science, i almost failed ceramics in 12th grade and as a consequence almost didn&#8217;t graduate, and, most dramatically, i didn&#8217;t know for sure i was going to graduate from college until *three* days before graduation day, with my parents and family friends already en route to see me on my big day.

i&#8217;ve been laying on my couch for an hour now, with both cats huddled on me wondering what&#8217;s wrong&#8212;any moment now, i&#8217;ll shake off this procrastination thing and i&#8217;ll open a new text document and my fingers will start flying&#8230; any moment now&#8230;

update: i caved. not only did i get the [nature cotton][1], i also ordered [three phildar mags][2] i&#8217;ve been eyeing for weeks. also, for purely practical reasons (free shipping!) i ordered rowan&#8217;s [vintage style][3]. my credit card is wilting. ah well. at least i put my stereo up for sale a few days ago&#8212;that should pay for the phildar ..

another update to make myself feel better: i have 14 (albeit not-very-cohesive) pages, it&#8217;s 7 am and i have four more hours to get this thing done. ack ack ack.
