<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="38" /></span> hi there ~ so yes, i finished classes, hip hip hooray. *and* i just got a plane ticket to go the family home for christmas, which is indeed a relief, i was starting to worry about finding even semi-resonable prices. 

as you can see, blocking happened. i don&#8217;t have a fancy board or even the room to spread out, plus i have cats that think every soft cushion-y area is set up especially for them, so i stack my blocked items and don&#8217;t take any showers till i&#8217;m done blocking (i&#8217;m a single gal after all, in a very small apartment. hence three, maybe four towels total.)<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="39" /></span>

however, as you can also see, i&#8217;ve attached a sleeve (actually both) and although last night i was all &#8216;fuck it! it&#8217;s done! i&#8217;m *not* re-redoing those sleeves!&#8217;, this morning, with more clarity (i.e. sleep), i reconsidered. sure, it&#8217;s a pain to seam. sure, i have no real idea what i&#8217;m doing, much less how much &#8216;ease&#8217; there is in each sleeve, much less where to put it. but look at that seam, for goodness sakes. it&#8217;s *o.k.* 

not good enough. i put wayyy to much effort, and emotional energy, darn it!, to just have an &#8220;o.k.&#8221; sweater, thank you very much. so&#8230; back to the drawing board. i&#8217;m looking around for help, online and off. in the new knitty (yay), there&#8217;s the second installment on [*designing* sleeves][1], which gives me some insight, but i need more. <span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="36"/></span> [this helps][2] but i think vogue knitting and that sweater patterns books i just got will help the most.

in the meantime, while mulling over whether to take a nap (i&#8217;m beat!) or start a-seaming, i played around with a photo of mine in photoshop. stop groaning, yes i&#8217;m a newbie and it shows. oh well. but it was fun and i especially like the grey and white one. (ooh, i dyed my hair recently &#8211; supposedly a whitewhite blonde but it came out more like strawberry blonde. also, you can see how tired i am in the color one. i need sleep!) actually i have like half a dozen on my desktop, all with different filters applied, but to post that many picture of myself, however altered, online at once takes more balls than i have. or more ego. either way, it&#8217;s a good thing, trust me. <span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="37"/></span>

some things on my mind recently:

  * ~ have you seen [these drawings of cartoon skeletons][3]? [from [kottke.org][4]] i&#8217;m hoping the next installment will be of barbies. the betty boop one that&#8217;s up now looks so out of proportion, so that makes me thing the barbie one would really be shocking. 
  * ~ go see [kinsey][5] if you haven&#8217;t yet, it&#8217;s really good. i don&#8217;t usually like liam neeson but just because of that movie, i kinda do now.
  * ~ i recently found two good online book sites that are cheeeeap: [bookclosouts.com][6] and [overstock.com][7]. they both have tons of knitting and kid&#8217;s lit books, my favs [recently][8].
  * ~ it&#8217;s taking a whollllle lot of control not to order any of [this][9]. remember, elann is evil (tempters that they are).
  * ~ i want to knit [this][10]. and i can&#8217;t help but like oh way too much of all their other stuff, sadly. thank goodness it&#8217;s too expensive for me. but i *could* knit that one sweater, couldn&#8217;t i? hm.
  * ~ today, [wangari][11] [maathai][12], founder of the [greenbelt][13] [movement][14] in kenya, was awarded the nobel peace prize. didn&#8217;t know much about her initially, but since reasearching a bit, i think [she][15]&#8217;s great.
  * ~ ok, ok, i keep adding stuff, can&#8217;t help it. &#8220;Did you know that Microsoft owns anything that you might post on MSN Spaces [their new online blogging application]?&#8221; [from [librarian in black][16]]
