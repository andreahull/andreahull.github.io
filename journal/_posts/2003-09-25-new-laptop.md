hello! 

got my new laptop today- yay! it&#8217;s an apple and so i was little wary at first since i&#8217;ve been using pcs since my mac se ten years ago&#8230; but it&#8217;s fabulous and the ipod-thing is just too good to be true. 

work is going good- i&#8217;m going down to 30 hours starting monday but with a significant raise at the same time so i shouldn&#8217;t be losing any money, just working less hours (maybe even making more money)! 

today was the first day of grad school&#8212;of course i had to be late to class, only by 3 or 4 minutes, but class was fully underway when i walked in. oh and packed! i think the room capacity is about 45 people and that&#8217;s how many are in the class. also the format was a bit of a shock- though i understand in the future it won&#8217;t be 3 1/2 hours of solid lecture. ay! however, the prof seems interested and serious in us really learning, so that&#8217;s cool. 

i feel a little overwhelmed right now &#8211; school, work, new gadgets, and of course there&#8217;s always more. there&#8217;s still my car alarm that needs fixing, i need a bed asap, i need to cull my clothing collection, need to put up bookshelves, oh and more more. &#8230; i&#8217;m really excited about school but just feeling like i need time and space to think and adjust. my last semester at bryn mawr was hellish, except for dancing & pubbing with katie!, and i&#8217;m a tad worried that that whole &#8216;time management&#8217;-thing won&#8217;t work this time either. but! i think i can do this. i just need no major drama and long-term thinking.

i&#8217;ve been feeling pretty nostalgic recently- missing everyone, especially family. the holidays are coming up but it&#8217;s hard to go home with work in the way. .. i need to eat more fruit. i need to do some exercising. i need to do a lot of reading..! 

october 21st i&#8217;m going to see lawrence lessig debate at usc with a former riaa executive. should be cool. and hopefully with such an excellent computer and connection (dsl! yay) this page should be moving along much much faster.. 

bye, andrea
