nyagous tomatos fruiting, hooray. and blondkopfchen tomato flowers getting ready to burst into bloom &#8211; that&#8217;s quite a lot of tomatos-to-be! all the tomato plants were grown from seed by me, so i&#8217;m very proud of them. <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" />

two california wonder pepper plants &#8211; the green pepper i&#8217;ll wait for, but the purple pepper was picked (say *that* three times fast!) wow, these pepper plants have really shot up &#8211; thank goodness i staked them.

then, two bugs in the garden &#8211; one is the hornworm (covered with [wasp eggs][1] that will eat it when hatched :Z !) and the other..? any ideas?

happy pepperoncini peppers &#8211; see all the red? and then a long view of my pepper and tomato plants &#8211; considering i only got them in the ground a little over a month ago, they&#8217;re doing reallllly well.

this cabbage is part of a little experimenting with fall gardening, so far so good, though i think the horses might have nibbled a little on one of the other cabbages. possible? and then a little slug is chilling out on some rhubarb leaves &#8211; the rhubarb is a originally from my grandmother&#8217;s garden on her farm, how cool is that.

some sweet mugwort grown from seeds planted near the stream &#8211; they look so small here, but i&#8217;m hoping they&#8217;ll shoot up in the month or so. lastly, my little harvest from today (plus some tomatos from volunteer tomato plants in the first raised beds from last year!)

happy august! i&#8217;m enjoying the summer but looking very forward to september ~ ~

p.s. two technology bits to add: i dropped bloglines and am using firefox&#8217;s add-on [brief][2] for rss feeds, so far so great. and secondly, i&#8217;m really liking google&#8217;s [picasa][3] &#8211; i love addings tags to my photos, plus it&#8217;s a lot more powerful than iphoto, for one. one problem is that it really takes up a lot of cpu, but it&#8217;s worth it for now.
