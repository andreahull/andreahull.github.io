sorry for the extended silence here. i got the flu and it&#8217;s been making me miserable for days now. i insisted on leaving the house tonight, or else i&#8217;d go stir-crazy, and that was nice, but now i&#8217;m back to miserable. 

interesting factoid: a fever is the body&#8217;s defense mechanism against bacteria that can&#8217;t survive above normal body temperatures. cool, huh. my poor body, i treat it so abysmally at times but it continues to do me right. 

in other news:  
~ i saw sicko, it was great  
~ i got a bike! for free, yay  
~ i made some shrinky dink lovelies  
~ i babysat all by myself four children under three for eight hrs  
~ i finished the kangaroo pocket on rogue, hooray
