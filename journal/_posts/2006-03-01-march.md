off to san francisco for the day in just a few hours ~ so very excited! i intend to enjoy every moment <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> in the meantime, a few links and a pic for you..

first, [project spectrum][1] has begun! every month, and maybe even more often, my background will change* to reflect the colors for that month and, as you can see, this month is red and pink. so i picked a, i think, great shot of.. can you guess what? answer below, thought not upside down <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" />

<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="810" /></span>here&#8217;s the progress on my fair isle bag ~ i&#8217;m happy with it so far. colorwork is really really fun to do and just speeds ahead. i was even able to fix an error a few rows down &#8211; totally not as hard as i thought it&#8217;d be. i&#8217;m taking it with me to s.f. to show off to [meowgirl][2], yay

~ check out the new [spindlicity][3]! it&#8217;s been re-designed and is just pure eye candy, really lovely. the patterns are cute (felted tea holders!) and the articles (flame yarn!) are good. *and* there&#8217;s a little book review in there by me, too.

~ the new [magknits][4] is up as well (and isn&#8217;t [knitty][5] due soon?) &#8211; i especially like the [delphine wilson-inspired top][6] 

~ i want to go [trapezing][7]. i&#8217;d feel like a bird, how cool would that be! [this spinner][8] posted about her own swinging and now i&#8217;m googling like mad to find l.a.-area resources.

~ things like [these little containers][9] recycyled out of old contact lens cases make me happy

~ cute elann free pattern [alert][10]

~ if you&#8217;ve read the last harry potter book, read [this][11] &#8211; a *very* interesting theory. warning: spoilers abound in the url alone, so don&#8217;t even hover over the link if you haven&#8217;t gotten through book six yet

~ another great reason to work in a library: [library cats map][12]

~ the internet archive, always incredible, has a great selection of [classic cartoons][13], including the eerily-pitched betty boop and annoying woody woodpecker. very fun. 

~ last but by no means least, congrats to all you [knitting olympians][14]! you make me proud 

happy march ~ ~

[*answer: right, blood! maybe initially disturbing, but really, we all have it; without it, we&#8217;re dead; and shoot, it&#8217;s pretty to boot. just think, we&#8217;re all walking around with all this red inside of us! is it only me that finds that fascinating? <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> * ]

update: just got back. had an excellent time &#8211; everyone should be so lucky to hang out with meowgirl &#8211; and though my legs are *exhausted* from walking (what a wimpy angeleno!), i now know that a majacraft rose is in my future for sure. exactly when, i don&#8217;t quite know, but that&#8217;s the wheel for me, hands down. more later.. it&#8217;s almost the weekend, yay
