[ <span style="color: green;">&#402;</span> = finished reading, for more info see my [booklist][5] ]

i have ten books on hold too, mostly fiction, but some knitting books thrown in there (mostly debbie bliss&#8217; baby books). 

for the year 2005, i&#8217;ve already paid $15.10 in fines, with $2.50 still waiting to be paid. do they count for this year though? mostly they were accrued last year. ah well. i know i&#8217;ll never be able to reach the low limites of [others][6].

you ask, is it still raining? we&#8217;ve gotten over 6 inches of rain in the past 72 hours, 2 of which were dumped on us [in the past 12 hours][7]. to keep this in context, [the norm][8] for l.a. is 2.76 inches for the *whole month* of january. i feel a little stir crazy &#8211; even for a water-crazy woman like myself, it is starting to get a bit ridiculous. don&#8217;t even ask about my car, ok?
