## by Nancie M Wiseman 

this book fills in where *stitch n&#8217; bitch*, and *vogue reference* as well, leave off &#8211; at least in regards to casting on, binding off, buttonhole-making, increases and descreases, seaming, and more.

the pictures are great, the explanations are clear, the writing is simple but understanding (!). i also much appreciate that it is spirally-bound, making it handy to open and easier to *keep* open. 

lastly, i love that not only do they explain how but also *why* you would choose one method over the other, in a way that for some reason just clicks with me.

[note: i have no idea why powell&#8217;s image is so old-fashioned looking. they must not have updated the image they have to reflect the new edition they&#8217;re selling.]
