## by Mary Thomas 

this was the first knitting book i bought, during my short-lived first try at knitting my junior year of college. along with this book, i got double-pointed needels and thick warm wool to make some knittens for me and the boy, but it all came to nothing. the book itself, however, stayed with me and once in a while i&#8217;d pick it up and daydream about being a knitter. 

the cute illustrations soften the serious-ness of the writing and old-fashioned style of the book in general. although an old book, the writing is not old at all. for example: &#8220;The quick staccato music of the 17th and 18th centuries must surely have found its inspiration in the rapid rhythmical &#8216;click&#8217; of the knitting needles.&#8221; (p.7)
