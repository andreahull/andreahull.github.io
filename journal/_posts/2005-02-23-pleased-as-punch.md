<span class="pic"><txp:image id="157" /></span>ah, what a great day already! no sarcasm, no hidden meaning, nothing, just &#8220;ohhh, what a beautiful morrrrrr-ning, ohhh what a beautiful daaaaaayyyy!&#8221; kind of thing..

first off, my secret pal triumphed yet *again* with this perfect gift: she knitted me up this beautiful mug-warmer! (oh what are these things called?! i&#8217;m googled-out, folks.) she wrote (in a really cute card, btw) that she wasn&#8217;t sure if i&#8217;m a coffee-tea-redbull kind of gal, so let me clarify: tea all the way! and by tea i mean gi-normous cups of mint tea. every tuesday, when i have my &#8220;all classes, all day&#8221; day, i drink so much tea i&#8217;m hopping up from my seat every twenty minutes if ya know what i mean. this lovely knitted object d&#8217;arte will come in handily, *and* i&#8217;ll feel so shnazzy and special, to boot.

secondly, i&#8217;m almost done on a certain creation of mine&#8212;but i haven&#8217;t decided yet to make it the full turtleneck-length or have a lower more-open neckline.. either way, it&#8217;s topsecret. <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" />

lastly, oh my apartment is overrun with ants, my hair is going curly-crazy (which i&#8217;m loving but also am having some control issues with&#8212;i gotta let that hair know *i&#8217;m* in charge here), and i&#8217;m behind on some important work-, school-, and other-stuff i gotta do, but hey! it stopped raining! and hey, i&#8217;ve got a plan, man!

happy happy day to all of you! and once again, you *rock* secret pal. (and don&#8217;t think i didn&#8217;t notice it was sent within the u.s.&#8212;though you cleverly hid *somehow* the state it was sent from.. sneaky *and* crafty is a dangerous combination.)
