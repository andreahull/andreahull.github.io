**update:** yay! i got my comments working again. phew, that was embarassing and frustrating since i get so few and get just *wayyy* too happy when i see them.

dagnammit, my comments are down again. i really like lunarpages, but i&#8217;m pretty annoyed at their recent &#8216;security&#8217; upgrades (suPHP); it&#8217;s driving me nuts.

for now, till i get the comments working again, here&#8217;s a nice photo.. that&#8217;s my sweet cat pepper ~ i got her in 6th grade and she died last year, at the age of 13. appropriate for a black cat. awww, she was the best cat in the world.

also, for knitters out there traveling to/from/around the u.s., [news from the transportation security administration][1] (i kid you not): &#8221; Knitting needles are permitted in your carry-on baggage or checked baggage. However, there is a possibility that the needles can be perceived as a possible weapon by the TSA screener. TSA Screeners have the authority to determine if an item could be used as a weapon and may not allow said item to pass through security. TSA recommends the following when bring knitting needles on an airplane: 

</p> 

  * * Circular knitting needles are recommended to be less than 31 inches in total length


  * * We recommend that the needles be made of bamboo or plastic (Not Metal)


  * * Scissors must have blunt points


  * * In case the screener does not allow your knitting tools through security it is recommended that you carry a self addressed envelope so that you can mail your tools back to yourself as opposed to surrendering them at the security check point.


  * * As a precautionary measure it is recommended that you carry a crochet hook with yarn to save the work you have already done in case your knitting tools are surrendered at the checkpoint.
</ul> 

Most of the items needed to pursue a Needlepoint project are permitted in your carry-on baggage or checked baggage with the exception of circular thread cutters or any cutter with a blade contained inside. These items cannot be taken through a Security Checkpoint. They must go in your checked baggage.&#8221;

hope you got a good chuckle out of that., along with some disblieving shaking of the head..

happy friday!
