<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="797" /></span>a great weekend but since then the week has really bit. i had my first spinning conversion at the dinner party on friday, but like a dork, forgot to take a pic of my star pupil. <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> no fear, she left my place with her own spindle, some fiber, and a good spinning mag &#8211; see? i&#8217;m a responsible spinner. ..the party was such a hit &#8211; i had a great great time catching up with friends and was relieved to see that seven people in my apartment was not too crowded at all. i&#8217;ve also been cooking like a madwoman: homemade applesauce, herbed croutons, herbed butter &#8211; can you tell i&#8217;m trying to use up my fresh (store-bought) herbs? &#8211; spinach lasagna and goat cheese gratin, watercress & endive salad, and even some chocolate fondue. delish.

my body hurts a lot recently &#8211; aches from actually using muscles that normally are allowed to just *be* and not actually do anything. one of my sisters drew up an exercise plan for toning and stuff and then with horseback riding classes <span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="798" /></span>(still loving it, just frustrated with the group lesson setting &#8211; just a few slowpokes and uninterested can bring the whole class to a halt, arggh), some part of my body is always a bit touchy. it feels good though &#8211; is cathartic the right word here?

on monday, i went with a handful of other library students up north to tour the library at the san luis obispo prison, &#8220;california mens&#8217; colony&#8221; &#8211; isn&#8217;t that bizarre it&#8217;s called a *colony*? anyhow, it was an all-day thing and really intense and i feel like i&#8217;m still kinda processing it. i think everyone in the u.s. should at some point bee inside a prison, just to get a glimse of what life is like for the many (with the numbers always growing) that spend years and years of their lives there. it was depressing to see all these *kids* there, just little ones, barely 20. the whole prison system is so friggin corrupt and inherently *wrong*, it&#8217;s just depressing and scary. &#8230; the focus should be on rehabilitation, and it&#8217;s not! people should not be in prison for non-violent crimes! <span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="799" /></span>they shouldn&#8217;t be put in jail for being addicted to drugs! the three strike law is bogus! etc etc. sigh. the library was a great thing to see &#8211; and there need to be many more! &#8211; but the setting was just too overwhelming to be able to focus on it much at all.

&#8230; so! i leave you with some happy photos (tequila is my mom&#8217;s dog, a typical trouble pose, and then my first spindle-spun *and* spindle-plyed yarn), in hopes of not scaring you off. i have the beatles&#8217; song in my head &#8220;it&#8217;s get-ting bettah all the tiiiime..&#8221; and a headache as well &#8211; what a lovely combo. off to write a paper, take a good long shower, and then maybe a nap. as my cousins say, chausito ~ ~
