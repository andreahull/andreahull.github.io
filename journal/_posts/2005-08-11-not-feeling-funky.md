bad bad mood. so i&#8217;ll be brief:

1) [some][1] [people][2] have asked me how i&#8217;m coming along on my <a [no-fines-unless-i-don&#8217;t-really-want-a-wheel][3]. it&#8217;s been almost three weeks and in that time my total fines have amounted to.. drum roll, please: twenty-five cents. yup, that makes me smile. i&#8217;ve had several very near misses &#8211; including forgetting to pay my phone bill (damn electronic bills! i miss paper.) and almost getting my phone disconnected (!), almost getting a parking ticket twice, and general library fine near-misses. phew. it&#8217;s hard. and i was pissed i got that 25 cent fine, but really, that&#8217;s pretty darn good.

of course i still have five weeks to go. and i&#8217;ve just jinxed myself incredibly, sigh.

2) antsy antsy me &#8211; i feel like pacing and shivering and groaning and ugh. not happy. maybe part of it is just hunger, though &#8211; i&#8217;m such a mood monster, if i haven&#8217;t eaten lunch yet, i start snapping like a crocodile with sharp sharp teeth (really, are there any other kinds of crocs?) i leave l.a. in six days and, like the whole rest of my family, i tend to stress a bit before leaving for any place, especially since i&#8217;m leaving to visit my family. and that&#8217;s inherently stressful, as much as i love them. also, my IA class is finishing up and that&#8217;s a tad worrisome too &#8211; i hate deadlines.

<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="331" /></span>so not to leave a bad taste in your mouths, i&#8217;ll try and upload some pretty pics when i get home tonight of a gorgeous bag of goodies [joy][4] left for me a few weeks that i *just* picked up from the ever-so-patient and sweet [winnie][5]. these kinds of goodness make me feel like a big old grouchy grouch. thank you!

and thanks on the nice words about orangina &#8211; i&#8217;m itching to knit more lace and just zone out, know what i mean? i think that&#8217;s what i&#8217;ll do tonight, and then tomorrow, pull myself up and get back on track with the The Ever-Expanding To-Do List. 

(why do i always feel better, even just the teeniest bit, after i post something here, no matter what my mood? always, really. thanks.)

update: damn. of course. just realized four books were overdue by one day &#8211; i could have renewed them yesterday but i forgot. so from twenty-five cents, make that $1.00 in fines. what&#8217;s the big deal right? chill pill right? no, seriously, library fines are the beginning of a very slipper slope, a gateway drug, etc etc. must repeat: not happy. off to buy yarn for [cozy][6], because that&#8217;s how i want to feel *right now*.
