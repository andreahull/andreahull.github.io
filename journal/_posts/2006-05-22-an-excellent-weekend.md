first things first: i passed. officially, i&#8217;ll graduate on june 19th &#8211; though i don&#8217;t think i&#8217;ll attend the ceremony, i&#8217;m just not big on those &#8211; but really i&#8217;m allll done. i have class still, true, but the real pressure is *off*. regarding the actual portfolio presentation, i&#8217;ll go into detail at a later date as there&#8217;s still one aspect that has me seeing red. grr. but for now, i&#8217;m trying to just shake that bit off and enjoy the fact that i&#8217;m done. done!

<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="863" /></span>*and* i had an excellent weekend. friday i was all sniffly and lost in memories, but saturday was much more relaxed &#8211; *plus* on saturday, the yarn in my preferred color came from elann in a record two days and i started on another project as well. so, here they are for now: crinkle from the latest rowan using knitpicks&#8217; shine and urban aran in elann&#8217;s peruvian highland chunky. 

sunday was the really exciting day &#8211; i went to my horse place to watch a horse show. man, there&#8217;s some fearless eight year olds out there! i think *i&#8217;m* small compared to horses! no comparison to those little kids, woah.

<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="864" /></span>from there, i went straight to the [topanga banjo & fiddle festival][1]. they&#8217;ve been having it for almost fifty years and it takes place at the paramount ranch, where they filmed all kinds of westerns, including *dr. quinn, medicine woman*, and is part of the mailbu state park, i believe. anyhow, even though there was the threat of rain all day, the weather was perfect and in fact, the clouds kept the weather warm-ish but not baking and the crowd big but not smothering. the best part was wandering away from the center stage, walking among the vendors set up in dr. quinn&#8217;s town <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> and hearing the various impromptu jams going on in every nook and cranny. 

literally, you could stand in some spots and hear five different groups. and the mixes! the bass-playing hipster girl with the jackie o. glasses and a 70 year old with a sassy red bandana strumming on a banjo, the two of them jamming away while a middle-aged woman sang her heart out as she swayed back and forth. an early 30s hiker (well, he had a fancy backpack, shoes, and one of those collapsible hats) with a teeny mandolin playing with a group of handlebar-moustached guitar players, all singing very softly but sweetly some old bluegrass. just lovely &#8211; so inspiring! i really admire musicians &#8211; especially those that are into spontaneous jams and singing and all that. i used to play piano &#8211; not terribly well, though i enjoyed it &#8211; but i was always too shy to play with others, much less improvise and all that. i kept grinning as a i walked around listening to all of them &#8211; who doesn&#8217;t love being surrounded by the sweet sounds of a guitar, a banjo, shoot, there was even a muscial saw! it didn&#8217;t hurt that a great spinning guild member who is a crackshot felter had a booth there, and there was a spinning demonstration as well, with some other guild members spinning and chatting away. last but definitely not least, i hung out with a couple of women from my library program &#8211; they totally rock, and we just had a great time sitting on a blanket and talking for a few hours. 

*then* after *that* (yup, i was busy), i went to [path to freedom][2] to watch a documentary on how cuba survived an equivalent of peak oil when the economic support from the soviet union disappeared and the u.s. went even crazier on their trade embargo. a real interesting film, but better than that was the crowd &#8211; a cool mom and i had a nice brief conversation that just set a great mood for the rest of the night, then [a woman][3] (hi there <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> ) who took the same drop spinning class i did almost three years ago recognized me from this website (how cool is that!) and so we chatted a bit, and then i had this great long conversation with a man about bikeriding and permaculture and all kinds of other fun stuff. 

all of this definitely revitalized me &#8211; bring on the weekdays, i&#8217;m ready for them! hope your weekend was equally lovely &#8211; and thanks for reading this far if you did. so chatty, and so few pics! there&#8217;s still my shawl also, which i wore all day today &#8211; i&#8217;m determined to take an outdoor shot with it, to do it justice, but hopefully i&#8217;ll get to that on wednesday.
