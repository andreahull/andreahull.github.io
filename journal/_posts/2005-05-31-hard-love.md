## by Ellen Wittlinger

the first time i picked up this book, i didn&#8217;t like it &#8211; i just looked at the cover, read the back jacket blurb, sighed at the oh-so-chic &#8216;zine&#8217; format, and reluctantly checked it out, since it *was* assigned to me for my <arconym title="young adult">ya</acronym> lit class.

but then finally, after reading *the perks of being a wallflower*, i was so excited about ya lit, that i just picked it up and read it in one sitting. so great &#8211; i love those nights, where you just can&#8217;t stop reading and it&#8217;s three a.m. and you&#8217;ve contorted your body into dozens of different reading slouches so that you can just *keep on* reading. this was a good book &#8211; i wish it&#8217;d been a hardback just so that when i finished it, i could close it with a satisfying thump. it would have gone along nicely with my satisfied sighing &#8211; what a great book.
