<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="786" /></span>&#8220;Comanche is a 10 year old, 15 hand Appaloosa gelding. He is 15 hands. He spent a year trail riding through Will Rogers park before coming to [Mill Creek][1] in 2000.&#8221;

i kept smiling after today&#8217;s riding lesson &#8211; my first in over fourteen years(!), the first of six in the next two months &#8211; and just felt so serene and happy. it went *great*. i&#8217;m such an idiot for not having taken recreation classes at ucla this whole time, though now that i type that i realize, hello! i had an almost full time job. hm. 

anyhow, that was very very fun. i have some theories about horsebackriding and life patterns and healing childhood hurts and all that, but it&#8217;ll wait. <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> next time, i gotta remember to break out the camera *before* the class is over. comanche looks a bit droopy here, but i think he&#8217;s just sad the little kid with the bucket full of apples went away. 

interesting fact: my old riding boots from when i was fourteen still fit but my old riding hat does not, i.e. my feet have not grown, but my head has. ha!

~ [priscilla gibson-roberts][2] is coming out with [a new spinning book][3]! she, of [knitting in the old way][4]-fame, is such a great writer and i&#8217;m thinking this book will be of use to all who spin, on spindles *or* on wheels. i know her [other spinning][5] book is highly regarded by some very good spinners already. [via [deb][6]]

~ [bolivia and knits][7]: now that the new bolivian president is visiting other heads of state, is he changing the way he dresses? no way. yay bolivia. [via francesca]

~ in more dyeing education, here&#8217;s a treat: a step-by-step image-plentiful [tutorial][8] on painting rovings from a workshop taught by deb menz.. (also check out the fun [online spinning game][9] ;0 )

~ i&#8217;ve been going over wikpedia&#8217;s [spinning][10] [entries][11], editing and adding stuff, and found this great link: [spin me a yarn][12] &#8211; spinning folklore from ballads, tales, myths and rhymes.  
<a href="skype:mellowtroubling?call" onclick="return skypeCheck();"><img src="http://www.skype.com/i/logos/skype.png" style="border: 1px dotted silver; padding: 2px; margin: 8px; float:right" width="140" height="72" alt="skype!" /></a>

~ a while back, i signed up for skype but promptly lost my login info. so, second try, here it is: if you&#8217;ve got [skype][13] too, click on the image and give me a call. <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> the connection sounds even clearer than it did when i tried it a year ago, incredible. i helped my dad today set it up in maryland on his new laptop, and it felt great. voip should be the new w00t!

~ wanting to felt, needing to felt. isn&#8217;t [this bag][14] adorable? love the color choices, too. 

~ i love the neckline on the latest [knitting fog pattern][15]!

~ and last but not least, [pom it is][16]! thanks.

ciao ~
