hello. so today is the big thank-god-it&#8217;s-once-a-year fund drive at work ~ that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s 7 am and i&#8217;m up. most people arrived at work this morning at 5:30. me? i&#8217;m sleeping in and not getting there till 8:30. and then we&#8217;ll all be there probably till 7 tonight when the thirteen hour marathon ends. (it actually *is* called a marathon. huh, never thought i&#8217;d participate in a marathon.) my job has been the website so please check out my hard work, it&#8217;ll make me very happy: [supportpra.org][1].

i&#8217;d been racking my brain for days trying to find a not dumpy but sleek thermometer-goal-reaching bit of code online, you know, to show graphically how much money we&#8217;re raising, how close we are to our goal. well, everything i found looked horrible, all pixelated and cheesy, and just not in keeping with the pretty clean look of the website. sometime yesterday afternoon a little lightbulb went off and i thought &#8216;aha! what about that bar-percentage-thingamajig all those knitting blogs?&#8217; so, i went off in search of it. 

(wahoo, just got a call from work, already raised $9000! 8% of our goal reached. phew, it&#8217;s going to be a long day. at least i get the fun part of upping that precentage bar every hour.. <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> 

anyhow, so i couldn&#8217;t find the original source for the percentage bar thing, i looked all over the place. i know, i could&#8217;ve just taken it off a site that used it (like the excellent [passioknit][2] &#8211; such pretty pictures!) but i wanted the original, sure to work. however, the woman who originally put it out, her blog &#8216;Anna Knits&#8217; was nowhere to be found. and then, another aha (this is really engrossing to you, i know.. ;P ) and off i went to the internet archive. score! [from feb. 2004][3], here&#8217;s the page. 

so, to save others that run around, here&#8217;s my copying and pasting of that same info:

&#8220;You might find something completely different to use it for, but I use it to display the percentage of a project done.

There are only 2 variables to set, and you can integrate it easily into more complex code, like I have here, or update it manually very simply. You can set the color and percentage to anything you want.

To put it on your site:

~ First download the <txp:file\_download\_link id="11">Flash file</txp:file\_download\_link>. (Right-click and &#8220;Save Target As&#8230;&#8221;) Copy it to your own server. Make a note of where you put it!

~ Wherever you want to put the percent bar, paste this code:

`<object classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,29,0" width="102" height="17"><br />
<param name="movie" value="(path)/percentbar.swf?percentage=100&#38;colorout=25BFE0"><br />
<param name="quality" value="high"><br />
<embed src="(path)/percentbar.swf?percentage=100&#38;colorout=25BFE0" quality="high" pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="102" height="17"></embed><br />
</object><br />
`

~ Edit the colored parts of the code, changing the &#8220;<font color="#009900">100</font>&#8221; to whatever percentage you would like to display. Change the "<font color="#CC0000">25BFE0</font>" to the hex code of whatever color you would like to use for the progress bar. Finally, if you didn&#8217;t put the Flash File in your root directory, replace "<font color="#0066CC">(path)</font>" with the path to the swf file. If it is in your root directory, omit "<font color="#0066CC">(path)</font>" altogether.

~ You&#8217;re done!&#8221;

**update:** the [anna knits][4] is back up&#8212;seems it was only down those few days i desperately needed it ;)&#8212;so go there for better, prettier, and the original information.
