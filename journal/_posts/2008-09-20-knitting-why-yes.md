my sister&#8217;s wedding shawl. almost done! good thing too, since she&#8217;s getting married october 4th. .. i&#8217;m running out the door with my mom, and then babysitting the nieces and nephew tonight, but i&#8217;ll try and get a better picture up soon. 

happy weekend to you all. it&#8217;s a beautiful end-of-summer day here in maryland, hope it&#8217;s equally nice where you are ~ ~
