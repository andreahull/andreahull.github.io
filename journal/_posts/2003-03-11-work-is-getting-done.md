hello.

i feel like it&#8217;s been so long since i&#8217;ve done anything with this site but really i have been working hard on backing up everything here and also getting this site all on dreamweaver on my computer-wth-no-web-access at home so that i can work from home on this site and then just upload it off a floppy at work every week.. anyhow, for now, i added [articles][1]{.norm} from the women&#8217;s movement, particularly [the tyranny of structurelessness][2]{.norm} by Jo Freeman and [the tyranny of tyranny][3]{.norm}, Cathy Levine&#8217;s reply. that&#8217;s it for now, hopefully i&#8217;ll get more up soooon. 

bye, andrea
