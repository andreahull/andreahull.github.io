it&#8217;s done. booked flights, moving container (a Relo-Cube, ack, what a name) contracted, cats added to flight list, family told. when? halloween, early afternoon.

my mom called this morning and my very-pregnant sister seems ready to pop, or rather the bouncing boy in her is rarin&#8217; to bounce right out. he&#8217;s not due until the 25th, but at this rate, he&#8217;d be a nine pounder+ if they waited that long, as he&#8217;s already 6 lbs 15 oz. !

anyhow, the birth is looking more like the 2nd of november, at the latest. so, my dates have moved up a bit, just a few days but it feels so real all of a sudden. i keep saying that, as weeks have passed, and yet it continues to surprise, how more-real it feels each and every time i remember &#8216;oh, i&#8217;m moving!&#8217;. i feel like my heart&#8217;s going to explode and shrivel up at the same time. arghhh. the last two nights i&#8217;ve been tossing and turning, my jaw clenched when i wake. when i manage to toss it off, i.e. not let my thoughts wander over *there* in the least bit, then i&#8217;m fine and happy and excited for the world and my life and all that cheeriness.

but right now? deluge. unhappy, unhappy. i hear the voices of my nieces over the phone, and i get excited. i look around at my apartment, and i want to call the whole thing off. i keep going back and forth, like an inane yo-yo.

ok. breathe, right? breathe. .. i feel doom pounding in my ears, a far off bach melody getting louder and heavier as it approaches. not a good attitude. lose-lost, right? .. 

warning: if i post at all in the next two weeks, there *will* be drama. lots of written sobbing. melodrama at the very least. i&#8217;m trying to do all this gracefully &#8211; this is something i *chose* after all and i believe this is a good thing, the right thing, to be doing, <span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="964" /></span>and it doesn&#8217;t have to be permanent, i could come back in *months* if i really wanted to &#8211; but that doesn&#8217;t make it really all that easier. and in fact, the coward in me wishes i had no choice, that it was up to someone else. 

i could go on, but poor you. it&#8217;ll be fine. i&#8217;ll be fine. what&#8217;s the big deal, right? right. everything will be great. ha! ok, sarcasm down, and here&#8217;s two pics to make this all a bit more palatable. it&#8217;s yarn i handpainted this weekend with natural dyes (a bit of an abrupt switch, huh) &#8211; pretty though, no?

hope your monday is *not* kicking your butt. <span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="965" /></span>

p.s. i found two &#8211; two! &#8211; holes in my madli&#8217;s shawl. it&#8217;s still all folded up from the discovery moment, i can&#8217;t bear to pull it out and figure what happened. not today at least. i feel like scarlett o&#8217;hara, but maybe tomorrow, yes, tomorrow i&#8217;ll face it. ugh.

p.s. again. posts i owe: a book meme, <strike>urban aran pics and write up</strike>, natural dye workshops #2 and #3, and <strike>a tonnnn of links</strike>.
