<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="1052" /></span>too many projects, never enough time! ah, that&#8217;s the way life is, huh. better that than the opposite, that&#8217;s for sure. anyhow, here&#8217;s my craftsy to do list:

~ turkish cape from vogue knitting. no picture here, it looks a lot [like before][1], but wider and with about four inches more to it. [stranded knitting][2] is not that bad, when it&#8217;s only two or three colors at a time.. four or five colors kicks my butt, though. in other words, blocking is my friend. 

~ stare in happy satisfaction at christmas goods. <span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="1051" /></span> besides the [three poetry in stitches/ norsk strikkedesign kits][3] (!), i also got a pound of the [almost solids series sampler][4], a tensioned lazy kate, and a distaff, hooray. then, pick a kit and start swatching.

~ stain the wheel the same walnut color the kate has. repeat with bobbins and niddy-noddy. a little intimidating, but my both my parents are expert stainers, or so they say. !

~ knit a [top-down raglan cardi][5] using a combo of handspun and leftovers. that&#8217;s a pound of delicious maryland-grown jacob 2-ply yarn, at 12 w.p.i. (more or less) and roughly 825 yards. <span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="1053" /></span> (btw, that&#8217;s two swatches &#8211; one as singles, the other as the 2-ply. neither was blocked, just washed. this yarn blooms beautifully!) i really like the colored yokes in [the opinionated knitter][6] but i don&#8217;t think i have enough of the colors i want, so it&#8217;s more as an inspiration. we&#8217;ll see what becomes of that.

~ dress that distaff and spin some more flax. yay for linen!

~ i have two [folkwear][7] patterns &#8211; one halfway done, the other not even started. sewing! more on that soon.

~ still have that beautiful [denise schmidt quilt kit][8] filled with quilty ideas. i also bought a pillow form, a rotary cutter, and found an old bag filled with fiber scraps. quilting!<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="1050" /></span>

~ while in asheville, yup, i succumbed to [two basket kits][9]. no pictures yet, it&#8217;s just too embarrassing to realize how deep in crafts i truly am. they&#8217;re beautiful kits, but for now, hidden under my bed. so, basketry!

~ [design (!) my mom&#8217;s cardigan][1] and knit it up already. this is going to be the most challenging project i think, but it&#8217;ll be sooo very satisfying at the end. designing! 

i have a few other secret projects, but this is a good enough list for now, no? gulp. 

happy tuesday ~ ~
