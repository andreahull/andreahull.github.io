um, i don&#8217;t think so. there&#8217;s just too much that&#8217;s interesting that i want to learn and do and.. if it&#8217;s not clear yet, i&#8217;m definitely one of those go-go-go! people (though i like to think i can totally chill now and then), that&#8217;s just my normal mode, for good or bad. so even now, after my sister left, i have two days of work to go, etc. there&#8217;s still so much. nothing booked, no firm plans till october, but my brain is bursting with to-do lists. thank goodness none of them binding.

~ one thing i&#8217;m really looking forward to when i go back east: a long-promised [intro to weaving][1] class at the famous [mannings][2] in pennsylvania

~ two handy links for those thinking about traveling cross country with their pets: [pets welcome][3] will show you a list of pet-friendly hotels along your specified route</a> plus they have a thorough [planning list][4] before the move happens.

~ there&#8217;s so many out there like this, but i like [librivox][5] (esp. this story, always loved it) for passing the time away on the bus, while walking, cooking, you name it.

~ my favorite so. cal. homesteading family has their own [video][6], check it out.

~ before i found out pets weren&#8217;t allowed, i was seriously considering traveling across the country [in a cozy train &#8216;roomette&#8217;][7]. ah well, another time. 

~ [<span class="caps">NASA</span> can&#8217;t find original tape of moon landing][8]. quote: &#8220;We haven&#8217;t seen them for quite a while. We&#8217;ve been looking for over a year and they haven&#8217;t turned up.&#8221; ! !!! sigh.

~ the new [craft zine][9] website is up &#8211; and the craft journal is coming out this fall. for those who already follow the [make blog][10], you&#8217;re probably already looking forward to it, but those who don&#8217;t, it&#8217;s by o&#8217;reilly, the same folks who bring you those animal-cover computer books.. mm, too nerdy?

~ didja know: &#8220;there are only three words in the English language with &#8216;dw&#8217; as the first letters. They are dwarf, dwindle, and dwell&#8221; [via comments on [this squeetus post][11] looking for wr- words]

~ i love reading posts from [the worsted witch][12] &#8211; if it&#8217;s not about [making ][13] [beauty products][14] [in your kitchen][15], understanding how [wasteful your lawn is][16], then it&#8217;s about [sustainability in the fiber & textile arts][17]. how great is that!

~ appropriately, [ How to Convert a Lawn to a Native Meadow or Woodland][18] [via worsted witch] &#8211; when i get my own place, i&#8217;m [totally][19] [doing this][20]. 

~ a friend at work told me about [this amazing][21] [opportunity][22] and now my mind is spinning with thoughts of that, [this][23], [this][24], and more. my plans for the winter are set, but beyond that, i have had fairly rough plans, but now.. who knows where i&#8217;ll be? my feet are starting to itch again, like they haven&#8217;t in years.
