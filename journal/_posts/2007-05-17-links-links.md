while i still can&#8217;t find a suitable recent pic for the last post, here&#8217;s some links that have been building up for so long now:

~ [book by its cover][1] &#8211; just a list of books that caught one designer&#8217;s eye, with nice pics too  
~ [running the numbers, an american self-portrait][2] is a set of amazingly detailed pics showing the waste we produce every year in this country.   
~ a great tutorial on how to use those [metal purse frames][3] to make purses out of fabric, felt, whatever  
~ [all about menstrual cups][4]. *very* informative site, filled with personal anecdotes and reccommendations.   
~ a cute [thumb tack tutorial][5] [via the [black apple][6] i think?]  
~ [book arts podcasts][7] from the university of alabama&#8217;s book arts program  
~ kinda old news, but there&#8217;s going to be a [billboard ban in san paolo][8]. i like that a lot.  
~ just washed my first fleece(!), and [this article][9] helped me a ton. in general, this website has great info all over its&#8217; pages.   
~ [christian marclay mini-documentary][10] on &#8216;unwanted sounds&#8217;. wish there was a way to include sounds in books so that when you&#8217;d turn the page, a sound would start. that&#8217;d be so cool, wouldn&#8217;t it? a book of sounds. but not on cd or whatever. hm.  
~ [arborsculpture][11]!!  
~ amazing [animated version][12] of the [bayeux tapestry][13], the famous needlework art that measures 20 inches wide and 230 feet long!! and depicts the norman invasion of england in 1066.   
~ [beautiful book on hungarian embroidery][14]. random fact: it weights over three pounds! wow.   
~ [learn the dance moves to ciara&#8217;s &#8217;1,2&#8217; song][15]. this guy also has a bunch of other videos up on youtube. sometimes boooring (he talks *a lot*), but still, it&#8217;s dancing, it can&#8217;t be that bad <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" />  
~ design*sponge&#8217;s [letterpress guide][16]   
~ on the very off off chance that a knitter hasn&#8217;t heard of it: [the walker treasury][17] has samples of the patterns from all the barbara walker books. really great site.  
~ a great list of [papermaking articles for beginners][18]  
~ the negatives to michael moore&#8217;s newest film &#8216;sicko&#8217; [are being stored outside the u.s.][19], just in case.  
~ [i want to learn to charleston!][20] though i&#8217;d love to hear the original music they dance to, i really like this daft punk song. ..isn&#8217;t dancing just amazing. always makes me feel happier about humanity. 

happy thursday ~ ~
