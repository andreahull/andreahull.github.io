i love love this knit ~ and i know i&#8217;ll definitely be using it a lot more on the east coast than in los angeles. i kept meaning to do a photo shoot outside of my apartment but a) embarassing, b) hard to do by oneself, c) i&#8217;m absolutely in love with my apartment and will miss it horribly when i go. so! there you have it, pretty light coming in the window, some cat appearances, and the all-important kitchen table.

now go out and knit your own urban aran ~ it&#8217;s just too too fun. of course, [more pics and info][1] on the project page.

* my hair changes so. i definitely play with color and length, but i&#8217;ve never gotten a perm or anything like that. some days it&#8217;s full of bouncy curls, other days plain Big as in Banshee, and then other days with just a bit of a wave to it. anyhow, fascinating to me. <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
