<span class="pic"><a href="http://zeneedle.typepad.com/give_a_little/"><txp:image id="349" /></a></span>*update: of course, knitters rock. a la [yarn harlot&#8217;s knitters without borders][1], [margene][2] and [susan][3] (of branching out fame) have started a knitting relief effort to help those who have been affected by hurricane katrina. the idea is, if you [donate][4] to the red cross (you can also call 1-800-435-7669 if the website is super slow), then [email][5] givealittle at gmail dot com and at the end of every week, those two lovely ladies will draw names and send out some fibery prize. for more info, see [here][6].</p> 

also, go read [liz][7]&#8217;s post with snips from a good, however scary, editorial. &#8220;The hurricane that struck Louisiana yesterday was nicknamed Katrina by the National Weather Service. [Its real name is global warming..][8]&#8221; </em>

*another update: and here&#8217;s more help you can give.. don&#8217;t forget all the [countless][9] [animals][10] &#8211; including [many][11] [many][12] beloved pets &#8211; that are also suffering after katrina! [thanks [stitchy][13] & [aunt pearl][14]] . also, if you&#8217;re looking to buy a gift for someone, yourself, whatever, why not get [a handmade crafty something][15] with all proceeds going to katrina aid? [thanks [heidi][16]]. *

hi there ~ it&#8217;s been a while, huh? 12 days without a single post! i leave for the aiport in a handful of hours, but wanted to drop a note saying yes, i&#8217;m safely out of new orleans and have been cooing over babies <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> for days and days now. lucky me! many more details about maryland, and pics and maybe even a short movie, later, once i&#8217;m back in l.a., but for now, here&#8217;s some photos of lovely new orleans from when i was there just eight days ago..

<div style="text-align: center; border: 1px dotted silver; padding-top: 11px; margin: 7px;">
  <txp:jmr_gallery category="345" />
</div>

the first two pics are of the typical intricate and beautiful architecture in new orleans &#8211; the first in the garden district, the second in the french quarter. then, my wifi set-up at the hilton where the conference was held (though my butt fell asleep sitting there working on the laptop, the fountain was a lovely accompaniament). next, a sign [lalitha][17] and i came up with (isn&#8217;t her yarn pic cute? it was pink glittery too!) calling all knitting archivists for an impromptu knit-up. lastly, though the photo doesn&#8217;t do it justice, a shot of the gorgeous sky that last day in new orleans &#8211; the clouds were sharp, gorgeously puffy, and with this intense backlighting that was breathtaking. 

new orleans is a city like no other i&#8217;ve ever been to &#8211; so very southern, but with these twists of something else, a little bit european, french, caribbean.. making it just uniquely itself. and the people so friendly and fun-loving. here&#8217;s hoping the worst is over for them and their beautiful city.
