my fall to-do list:

~ get my own printing press (1)  
~ make a quilt (3)  
~ knit a handspun sweater (5)  
~ spin up a fleece already (4)  
~ make cheese! (2)

~ sell some handmade paper   
~ take advantage of a real autumn(!) & bike a lot more  
~ for every easy read or two, a more demanding book next  
~ pay off most if not all credit card debt  
~ take lots of pictures  
~ draw more & carve too  
~ tickle some ivories now and again  
~ get rid of a lot of excess stuff: books, clothing, yarn, etc.

i really like making lists, but i&#8217;ve learned not to put too much energy into making them or else, once the list is done, i feel like i&#8217;ve already accomplished a lot and i take a break(!). it&#8217;s split in two because the first group consists of single projects (which i&#8217;ve prioritized) versus the group below which has more on-going projects. i&#8217;ve done little bits of all of that second group already, i just want to not forget to keep doing them. that first group is rather intimidating but absolutely exciting at the same time. 

and now, for you:

~ linocut artist steve alcorn [details his art&#8217;s growth over the years][1].  
~ this woman committed to making[50 books in 50 days][2], pretty inspiring  
~ the [mid-atlantic radical bookfair][3] in baltimore is coming up and i can&#8217;t wait for it. yay!  
~ [examples of crown braids][4]- some make me think ren fair in a not-so-flattering way, though i do love rennaisance fairs, but others are quite cool  
~ &#8220;All-One! We are all One!&#8221; ..if it rings a bell, check [this film][5] out  
~ [chart sweep videos][6] on youtube that play ten seconds or so of every song that hit #1 on the billboard charts by year, starting in the late 50s.   
~ patrick dougherty&#8217;s [stickwork][7] [via [folk & fairy][8] &#8211; i like the pics she took especially]  
~ [this][9] lib. of congress exhibit shows [old photos of russia][10] in their original color &#8211; not b&w! -, using a [unique photo method][11]  
~ [knitted tetris blanket][12] &#8211; i&#8217;d like to see it knit at a finer gauge, but still a fun idea  
~ i&#8217;m taking a workshop on artists&#8217; books in a few weeks and found the instructors&#8217; website &#8211; [check out whirlpool][13] especially, though i like looking at all of them  
~ a [pretty lunar calendar][14] &#8211; i love calendars, lunar all the more so.

and that&#8217;s that. happy friday ~
