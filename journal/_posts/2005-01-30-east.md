## by Edith Pattou

a good book that didn&#8217;t quite live up to my expectations. the cover is so beautiful and i&#8217;ve always loved the fairy tale &#8216;east of the sun, west of the moon&#8217; &#8211; but this re-telling, though starting out so promisingly, felt quite rushed at the end and way too tidy. ah well.
