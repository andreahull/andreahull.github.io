ah, i love librarians. and this book made me feel i definitely gotta study the wpa some more, and the great depression in general, too. besides all that, i also really enjoy and appreciate documentaries and any other format that uses original documents, such as, in this case, pictures of actual pack horse librarians trudging through scary looking snow in the middle of kentucky. 

these women are my heros!
