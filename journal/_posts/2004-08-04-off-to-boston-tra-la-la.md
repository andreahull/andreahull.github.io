yay, i&#8217;m off! the last few days have passed in a blur ~ but a beautiful blur. i have a list of good places to go to, including bookstores and yarn stores, and i&#8217;m taking my ipod, lots of yarn, great books, and a comfy p.j. or two ~ i plan on doing a lot of relaxing and sleeping. it&#8217;s a working trip but i&#8217;ll be in nice hotels, with soft sheets and cable tv. oh ho, a life of luxury for me!

plus there&#8217;s all the exciting <acronym title="society of american archivists">saa</acronym> workshops and panel discussions, such as:

  * &#187; the impact of the <acronym title="Uniting &#38; Strengthening of American by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism">usa patriot</acronym> act on archives & archivists
  * &#187; political pressure and the archival record: american perspectives
  * &#187; ethics in the archives: real-world strategies for real-world archivists
  * &#187; scandal in the exhibit hall: gay/lesbian/bisexual history exhibits
  * &#187; history versus heritage: when archives challenge popular beliefs

too bad i have no power suits to wear (ha). now, if only my hair will be obedient for once in its life ~ then i&#8217;ll be fine. if not, ay, lots of stares as i have pretty BIG hair and with east coast humidity added ~ sigh. i better pack a lot of hair gel.

so, in other news, i installed [textpattern][1]! for now, to see past posts, at least the last ten, see the drop-down menu on the left or click on the &#8216;older&#8217; tag below to go through each post one at a time. i know, i know, not the tidiest. but i already feel kinda insane for doing this big switcheroo literally two days ago. i still got to add the comments from before and most of the pictures. also, i&#8217;m trying to get up a calendar like i had before but i&#8217;ve run into some snags. more info on textpattern soon ~ but so far, very exciting and definitely challenging.
