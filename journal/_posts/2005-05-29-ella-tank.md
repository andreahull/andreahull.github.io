this was my very first attempt at cables and i&#8217;m very happy with the results! the very day i recieved the yarn &#8211; a long-aniticipated package from my secret pal [kimberli][4], thank you kimberli!! &#8211; i immediately broke open all my knitting mags and looked for the perfect pattern. this yarn is so great &#8211; perfect for early summer in l.a. : it&#8217;s a cotton blend that super-bouncy and cushion-y and once you get then hang of it, it barely snags at all. the yardage is fantastic &#8211; i have two balls left over and i want to make something with them, but what i don&#8217;t know! &#8211; and it&#8217;s theoretically machine-washable. 

the plassard pattern itself&#8212;ahh, a total mess! no too tough to figure out once you&#8217;re on the look-out but until then, a little bit of a headache. basically where it says C4L you really want C4F, where it says C4R you want C4B. also, although the center panel pattern repeats three times, it&#8217;s a little different each time: the bottom C4F cables repeat four times at the bottom, three times in the middle, and i got it only to repeat twice at the top&#8212;if i&#8217;d gone for a third repeat like the model had, i would&#8217;ve ended up with a turtleneck tank!

seaming was easy as pie, the first time i think i did the mattress stitch totally right, which was exciting <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> though it could have been entirely knitted in the round and saved the mess of seaming.

also this was the first time i did provisional casting on &#8211; not that it&#8217;s necessary in my opinion&#8212;at least with the yarn i used, i don&#8217;t think it made the slightest difference visually or in the wearing of it. 

i really love the back of the top &#8211; ribs are so fun to do and look so dang crisp and professional, i love that. plus ribs make me feel super curvy, which is always nice <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> however, i&#8217;m not sure about how it fits me overall &#8211; sometimes i love it, other time i think it makes me look like i have no waist! no biggie though, for now it&#8217;s done and i&#8217;m proud, yay.
