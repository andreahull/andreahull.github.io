hey there ~ 

<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="44" /></span>it&#8217;s almost 11 am here on the east coast and i have a few minutes of break time, all alone, for the first time since i got home yesterday morning at 6 am. i love my family but we are a pretty intense bunch &#8211; so time like this is precious indeed. any minute my mom will walk in the door with a ton of food that needs to be laid out for an impromptu holiday brunch/belated birthday celebration for my nephew niko. also, any minute my brother, sister-in-law, and their two kids, ri & niko, will ring the door, ready <span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="45" /></span>for some tree decorating. and, any minute my dad and two younger sisters will drive up in the truck with a big beautiful tree. very fun, glad i have a camera to take photos, but sigh, this silence right now is very nice indeed. 

whenever i&#8217;m around my sisters, especially, at least the last bunch of times we&#8217;ve hung out, we really get to talking about serious issues: relationships, sex, fears we have, goals and dreams, in short, all the good stuff. in between we squeeze in singing silly 80s songs together (for some reason, A-ha means christmas to us, <span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="46" /></span>especially their first album) and practically swooning and/or squealing over christmas anticipation and happiness. i love my sisters, and love these opportunities to chat and catch up on each other&#8217;s lives.

i finally got to meet my lovely new niece <strike>- pictures forthcoming, promise</strike>. she is an adorable sweet baby, softly exuding that great baby smell all little ones seem to come with, with the most animated eyebrows and, in general, face, i&#8217;ve ever seen on a baby. of course, to have my sister as her mom, she&#8217;s gotta get good at that since my sister is the champ at happy loud exclmations, full of eyebrow waggling. 

<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="47" /></span>ok, off to steal a few more minutes reading.. at 1 pm my little sisters and me gotta go decorate for my older sister&#8217;s baby shower we&#8217;re helping to throw for her today. phew, busy day coming up.

hoping your day is great and hopefully very relaxing. <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" />

p.s. just got a phone call from luci, one of the twins, saying that our tree is on the way but warning &#8220;it has a lot of personality&#8221;. hm. then i heard my dad in the background saying &#8220;tell her it&#8217;s flat on the bottom with very little on top. tell her!&#8221; and then luci hung up. hah, i love my family.
