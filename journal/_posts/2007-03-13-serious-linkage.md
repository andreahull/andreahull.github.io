i have lots of little projects going on &#8211; some just in my head, but some that other people can actually see. here&#8217;s the result, so far, of some of the head ones:

food glorious food..  
~ one woman&#8217;s list of [ 5 foods to eat before you die][1]  
~ [real people eat local][2]  
~ can&#8217;t wait until [sunday][3]!  
~ the most complete listings of [maryland <acronym title="community supported agriculture">csa</acronym>s][4] i&#8217;ve been able to find so far  
~ [pupusas and curtido][5], mmm. missing being able to see buy good ranchero and cotija cheese from the local market. also, i just realized i left my [tortilla press][6] *and* my [comal][7] behind in l.a. <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" />

window shopping..  
~ what a pretty [pretty cowl-neck dress][8]  
~ st- paddy&#8217;s day [earrings][9] &#8211; my grandmother had this knack of finding four-leaf clovers that was amazing  
~ [little pouch kit][10] at plainmabel.com, which is closing!

rubberstamping and papermaking..  
~ [hand carved stamps][11]  
~ using [staedler erasers][12]  
~ [more transfer methods][13]  
~ but really, here&#8217;s the [best tutorial][14]  
~ [mm, papermaking][15]. yay!  
~ uh-oh, fiber is enjoyable in [all its formats][16]

paper toys..!  
~ [eloole toy][17]  
~ [disney movie machine][18]. i&#8217;m not a big disney fan, but i *do* like this  
~ [paper forest][19] has lists and lists of more paper toys to download and cut out. very fun. stay tuned.

book recommendations & authors&#8217; sites:  
~ [laura mccaffrey&#8217;s suggestions][20]  
~ robin mckinley has a [new book][21] coming out this fall, hooray!  
~ [dia calhoun][22] wrote a really interesting YA story about a girl with manic depression, so i want to remember to get more of her stuff out.  
~ a list of all past nominees for the [mythopoeic fantasy award][23]; must be a good list for all fantasy lovers out there  
~ if i ever became a writer, i&#8217;d definitely be more of a [hummingbird than an owl][24], though i&#8217;d aspire to owlish ways  
~ [endicott studio&#8217;s recommended reading lists][25] look tremendously good for those interested in fairy tales and myths, both old and modern

also..  
~ [lemon water is good for cancer prevention!][26] i&#8217;ve been pretty good this week about drinking lots & lots of lemon water, yay.  
~ hmm, should i get [some tags][27] for my handknits and such?  
~ after years of meaning to, i finally joined a local [freecycle][28] group and it&#8217;s just amazing the variety of stuff i&#8217;ve seen offered and taken in just two days: baby gates, journals &#8220;with only a few pages written on&#8221;, computer monitors, pirate-themed clothing, juicers, a mailbox, and even car parts. wow.  
~ the [maryland sheep & wool festival][29] schedule is up.. and this year i finally get to go! who else is going?<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="1108" /></span>  
~ [folkstreams.net][30] features full-length documentaries on mostly music but also all kinds of other topics. great.

other than that.. oh, i miss people. i see a lot of family, which is really great, but i miss seeing people who haven&#8217;t known me since i was born, people i chose, you know? i should go out and meet new people, i know, but the whole idea is just exhausting. i already have lots of people i like, they&#8217;re just three thousand+ miles away. 

ok, off my butt and enough with the complaining, breakfast calls. here&#8217;s a random pic of the last of winter, i&#8217;m thinking. any guesses as to what it is?

bye ~
