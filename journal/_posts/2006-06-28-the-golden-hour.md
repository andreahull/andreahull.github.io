      a one-night read, i was caught up in the story within twenty pages &#8211; a good sign. the characters and setting were well-thought out and quickly i started thinking this was going to be a series, since there was so much buildup to the actual action. unfortunately, i think this book suffers from what so many others do &#8211; especially those by first-time or newish authors: the ending was just way too rushed! too pat, the boy a little too mature in all the right ways, etc. all in all, a feeling that there was a certain rhythm going on that had been stopped mid-beat and us the dancers, that is, readers, are just looking around waiting for it to pick up again. ah well &#8211; still a good book, good writing, and memorable characters.
