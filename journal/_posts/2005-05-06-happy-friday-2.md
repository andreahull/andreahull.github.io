<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="246" /></span>my niece kiyra will be baptised later this month and i&#8217;d been trying to decide what to make as a gift. i kept waffling and finally yesterday it just clicked and i decided on erika knight&#8217;s beautiful lacy bonnet from her &#8216;knitting for two&#8217; book that i got our from the library (can i mention again how much i love the l.a. library system &#8211; you can get *anything*!) 

i couldn&#8217;t find cotton wool in any pretty baby colors &#8211; only shocking fuschias and moody purples, so instead i went with an off-white baby cashmerino and last night i sat down and knitted the whole thing in one night. (i knew joining [the baby kal][1] would help me motivate <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> ) following the suggestions made to sweet georgia when she made [her own lacy bonnet][2], i&#8217;m not going with the ribbon suggested in the book but instead knit a delicate icord. also, i still have to finish what you see here&#8212;it&#8217;s ugly: pick up over 50 stitches at the edge and knit two rows. might not sound ugly to you but i&#8217;m really really bad at picking up stitches, ugh!

anyhow, my question to you all is: it only took about 1/2 of the baby cashmerino skein (i love that! the book called for *two* skeins of wool cotton) so i&#8217;m thinking if i have time in the next week before i have to send it off, i should make some booties or socks for my sweet niece. however, therein lies the problem: can anyone suggest a good pattern? a while back, i tried making some debbie bliss booties but there was too much seaming and weaving in ends and it ended up making the booties too stiff. i&#8217;ve read good things about the last minute gifts&#8217; booties but i don&#8217;t have access to that book except if i buy it, which i don&#8217;t want to do. the snb nation booties look ok but i don&#8217;t know how well they&#8217;d work with cashmerino.

this is my first time knitting with this yarn and it was so heavenly&#8212;so soft and luxurious feeling, perfect to lay against a baby&#8217;s cheek. definitely not the ideal knit for a new mom who shouldn&#8217;t have to handwash *anything* but i figured it&#8217;s for a baptism, so it&#8217;s gotta be special. 

have a great weekend everyone&#8212;and i&#8217;m talking to all you non-mdsw folk out there, cause i know the lucky ones will indeed have a great weekend.
