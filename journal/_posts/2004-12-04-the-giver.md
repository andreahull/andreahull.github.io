## by Lois Lowry

how did i miss reading this book all these years? i can&#8217;t wait to read the rest in the trilogy. this was such a great book, i wish i had read it more slowly, but as it was, it took some discipline to slow down..

i didn&#8217;t like the *Anastasia* books (also written by this author) when i was little, i remember feeling like they were laughing at me, or winking or something, and that, of course, was. not. allowed. though this book does, at times, seem a little too &#8216;ooh, ooh, there&#8217;s a mystery, how exciting&#8217; at times, the ideas behind the writing and the non-drama of the characters themselves give it enough weight to make it just right.
