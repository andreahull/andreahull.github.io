hi. i got back from mexico (it was great great &#8211; i&#8217;ll post some pics soon) and now find myself in a bit of a puzzle and not a little frustrated. where do i begin?

my first year of library school is over and i could, if i worked real hard, finish a year from now, though i might just take it a little easier and graduate a year and a half from now. either way, that&#8217;s to figure out in the winter or spring. but for sure, this year is over. i&#8217;m taking one summer class only, and even that one might be dropped if i&#8217;m just not feeling it.

that leaves me, at least for the month of july and most of september (ucla starts classes at the end of september; august is booked solid with five days or so devoted to [saa][1] and ten days to italy with my family), with an incredible amount of free time. all i have scheduled for those roughly eight weeks is thirty hours of work a week, maybe one class on tuesday afternoons, and a birthday party on july 3rd.

so what&#8217;s my problem? i feel bewildered, i guess &#8211; the last two months or so i&#8217;ve been feeling pretty stressed and unhappy with the loss of control i feel over my time. it&#8217;s been building up since beginning school again, but i could handle it the first few months since i had two years before that of no school and lots and lots of unstructured time. but, with the winter quarter and definitely by the spring quarter, i became a complete hog with my free time. understandable, i think. but not very nice to be around and ultimately made me feel pretty guilty and defensive and just give in whole-hog (lots of pig-words here..) to my escapist tendencies. ay. (see, this is what&#8217;s good about blogging/journaling..) i&#8217;m realizing what&#8217;s been making me feel antsy and grumpy all day. i mean, i woke up this morning and just felt argh. confusing, right? wasn&#8217;t i supposed to be really but really happy today, now that classes are finally over, no family responsibilities or plans (not that i didn&#8217;t love that you visied mami, but you know..), just free free time?

[Grace Llewellyn][2], who wrote the incredible [teenage liberation handbook][3], which talks about homeschooling, or as she calls it, &#8220;un-schooling&#8221;, harps on the need for detoxing after deciding to leave the traditional schooling system. i read this book the year i graduated from bryn mawr and it just clicked, making so much sense. i was so stressed out that last year, just so unhappy, really. and i knew, starting this program at ucla, that the same thing could happen again. in fact, *would* happen again unless i took at least some strong precautions, such as from the get go planning to graduate in three versus two years.

anyhow, in the book, llewellyn says how that detox time &#8211; ranging from anywere from a week to six months &#8211; is the time to plan nothing. that&#8217;s it, nothing. (i&#8217;ll look up the exact phrasing when i get home later today.)

i remember last december, i was getting all excited about the free two weeks vacation i would have here in l.a. after the winter quarter was over and i would be back from the hectic greatness of family holidays, and i was making this really ambitious to-do list, and vacya suggested that maybe i would be happier not to plan anything and just do what i wanted to, like a vacation should be. he was right, and i was really happy those weeks.

so, once again, i feel the urge to make big to-do lists and structure all my time. but no! i don&#8217;t want to. and i won&#8217;t! i&#8217;m interested in so much stuff, i will not tie myself done to this or that, i&#8217;ve done that already for most of this year. i won&#8217;t do it for my vacation. and this **is** vacation. it&#8217;s so much easier to be firm when away from my job/l.a./apartment. then, it&#8217;s like &#8220;no, no tours, thank you&#8221; and &#8220;no, i just want to sit by the pool/ocean and do nothing (i.e. read, laugh, take pictures, write, listen to music, play, dream, sleep, eat)&#8221;.

i&#8217;ll think about this some more, and edit/shorten this whole post a bit, but here&#8217;s a good quote from one reader (from [amazon][4], but if you&#8217;re going to get the book, try [isbn.nu][4]), &#8220;..i have spent the last decade of my life unlearning bad habits that are directly a result of being coerced for years into doing things that are irrelevant to my life, and being subject to arbitrary authorities.&#8221; exactly. and: &#8220;it is nothing short of a miracle that the modern methods of instruction have not yet entirely strangled the holy curiousity of inquiry; for this delicate little plant, aside from stimulation, stands mainly in need of freedom; without this it goes to wreck and ruin. it is a very grave mistake to think that the enjoyment of seeing and searching can be promoted by means of coercion and a sense of duty.&#8221; &#8212; albert einstein
