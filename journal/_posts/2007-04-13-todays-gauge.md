some tunes: [here][1]

some notes:  
~ i want to live on a cliff too. and have a wooden gate made out of twigs.   
~ i have more papercuts now than i&#8217;ve had since i was a kid. the hurt lingers more than i remember, especially on the palm.  
~ my ever-patient capacity for feeling sorry for myself far outstrips what anyone could feel for me in that regard. sometimes i think that&#8217;s horrible, other times i&#8217;m just relieved.  
~ brian wilson was right about rooms.   
~ music and showers are the only things that *always* cheer me up.   
~ i have a new-found love for foxes. real ones, not cartoon ones.   
~ i told my three-year-old nephew the other day that that this year is going to be the year he learns to share. he shouted back &#8220;no!&#8221; &#8211; i feel the same way about my lesson for the year, which is consistency &#8211; not in the arts sense so much as a day-to-day regularity, time management, longterm plans fulfillment, etc. 

off to vacuum and blast music in an attempt to not pace *or* space out.
