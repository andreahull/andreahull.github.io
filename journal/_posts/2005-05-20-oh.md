[Happy Army-Recruiter-Free Day!][1] see [here][2] especially. remember the video game [america&#8217;s army][3]? sick. and how about [not letting the cia conduct marketing campaigns][4] on colleges too, ok? if you know someone of high school and college-age, and don&#8217;t we all?, pass on [this info][5] &#8211; kids are being targeted like we never were, in slick sick ways and straight out lying ways. some kids *are* fighting back; i particularly like [this slogan][6]: &#8220;racist, sexist, anti-gay, u.s. military go away.&#8221;

in knitting news, i&#8217;m kicking cable ass and i&#8217;m oh so proud, yay. the cables in the pattern are written wrong, so i&#8217;ve had to study the model picture a lot and frog a lot, a major pain, but at least i&#8217;m really feeling the whole cable thing &#8211; it totally makes sense to me now, fifty rows in. yeehaw! no pics though since my sick cough cough computer is acting up. also, yesterday i caved and bought more yarn. ..at least it was on major sale! i need to update that stash page, or should i call it &#8216;andrea&#8217;s album of shame&#8217;.

lastly, i did *five* loads of laundry last night. oh my, too much clothing! and i&#8217;m noticing trends: lots and lots of pinks and reds. when did that start?!

update: agh! i just proudly showed off my cables to a fellow knitter, a very sweet cool woman, and she remarked that it was great but that i needed to twist my stitches the same way consistently, adding, at seeing my face fall, &#8220;but no one but a knitter would notice!&#8221; ;( she meant well but it still makes me feel all ugh. there *are* disadvantages to being self- and book-taught. 

and *another* update: so after stewing about it during lunch, trying to convince myself it&#8217;s not a big deal, it still looks really nice and crisp and that twisted stitches are rockin&#8217;, i came back and talked to my friend and we realized i *wasn&#8217;t* actually twisting and a good blocking would fix any seemingly irregular stitches. yay! my friday can go on in peace and happiness.
