[this][1] is pissing me off:

> In a segment on the surge of evacuees to the Texas city, Barbara Bush said: &#8220;What Iâ€™m hearing which is sort of scary is they all want to stay in Texas. Everyone is so overwhelmed by the hospitality. **And so many of the people in the arena here, you know, were underprivileged anyway so this (she chuckled)&#8212;this is working very well for them.**&#8220;</p>
what a major major bitch. i [shouldn&#8217;t be surprised by this][2] i guess. 

it&#8217;s way past time for me, and many many others, to get our heads out of the sand. 

[from dem now][3], when i heard it, it hit me like a gong: 

> &#8220;JUAN GONZALEZ: And what can Americans who are concerned about the lack of attention of our federal government to this issue, what can they do?</p> 
> 
> ROSS GELBSPAN: Unfortunately, **it has to be political action. It&#8217;s not lifestyle action**. Even if we all sat in the dark and rode bicycles, it would not stop global warming&#8230; We need to take the lead in spearheading a rapid transition to clean energy. That will happen only through political pressure&#8230;&#8221;

and this goes way beyond energy and enviromental issues &#8211; though sometimes when i think about what we&#8217;re doing to this world of ours, i just think holy crap, we are *so screwed* &#8211; including war, major mass-denial class and race issues, who we let be in charge around here, etc etc.

all words, very easy to say. 

in between moments like these, when i&#8217;m just trying to find tons of information and wondering and seething, i escape. cowardly, i know. but i do &#8211; i&#8217;ve watched probably ten movies in the last three days, and actually have a completed knitted thing, and i&#8217;m definitely caught up on sleep, and if i take another shower, i&#8217;ll probably turn permanently into a raisin. (there&#8217;s even been some spinning, that was great.)

[not all of my emotions are coming from anger about [katrina][4]/<a href="[new orleans][5]/[bush idiocies][6]/[condi shopping][7]/ etc, but from other personal upheavels. i&#8217;ll be ok. just wanted to add this so.. i don&#8217;t know, so the context is more real. ]
