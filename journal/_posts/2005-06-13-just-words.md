such a tease. i promised pictures, especially ones of orangina, but still nothing nada zip. school ends wednesday, my computer is still at the computer hospital, and i&#8217;ve become a reading freak again. ah yes, reading &#8211; what i *used* to do with all my free time until knitting and the [internetS][1] came around. and this shift back to reading got me thinking last night.. really, i always knew i was being shaped by all that reading, by all the computer learning and internet browsing, but i never really though about what effect knitting was having on me. granted, i could make beautiful things, and i could spend my time happily knitting for hours without even realizing it. but there have been some serious and mostly great effects. in no particular order:

  * ~ i can deconstruct clothing much better &#8211; even though i haven&#8217;t finished a single sock, i understand the heel flap, the gusset; i also get why seaming in fitted garments adds need structure sometimes, why one type of yarn/knitted fabric is too heavy for some patterns; how [proportional][2] the body truly is, including mine! <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" />

  * ~ i can now listen to an audiobook all the way through. this is quite an accomplishment because no matter how i try, unless it&#8217;s a big old hardback, i just can&#8217;t get into reading while knitting &#8211; i would love love to, but it just hasn&#8217;t worked yet. but audiobooks &#8211; wow, that works. i agree with [others][3] (great link, check it out, really!) to not overburden yourself while listening, and knitting is perfect for that &#8211; or at least knitting the miles of stockinette we encounter all-too-often in our knitting projects.* i just listened to david allmond&#8217;s *kit&#8217;s wilderness* and the old agatha christie *murder on the orient express* and both were excellent and perfect for knitting. or washing dishes and mopping the floor, too, i might add. 

  * ~ because of knitting, i&#8217;m not as lazy as i used to be. i used to be able to just sit there and totally be that couch potato for hours and hours &#8211; now though, even if the movie is good, i tend to get antsy and can&#8217;t concentrate *unless* i have knitting in my hands. it&#8217;s like the old &#8220;idle hand&#8217;s are the devil&#8217;s workshop&#8221; &#8211; i&#8217;m all for just sitting there and contemplating things and just being *still*, especially in nature, but tv-watching is never and i mean *never* that. now, though, just like that, poof, the guilt is gone: i&#8217;m not a couch potato, i&#8217;m a multi-tasking knitter <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" />

  * ~ i&#8217;m more aware of how fragile and dependent i am on my hands and wrists &#8211; after some itty-bitty fidgety cotton knitting, i always get worried and wonder. both of my grandmothers had problems with [osteoporosis][4] and my dad&#8217;s mom had pretty severe arthiritis. i remember her during the last years, her hands were just permanently all curled up.. that&#8217;s really messed up, isn&#8217;t it? i&#8217;m hoping knitting will keep my hands flexible and limber and all that, but there&#8217;s the extreme where i&#8217;ll develop some [carpal tunnel syndrome][5] kind of thing, especially combined with my computer use and bad ergonomics both at work and at home. (laptops will do that to you faster, i think &#8211; one definite negative.)*

ah, there&#8217;s more, but work calls. <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> any you wish to add? (check [this][6] out too &#8211; i&#8217;d add a few things for sure, but it&#8217;s a great starting list..)

**(if you did see the link, though, i disagree with what he says about listening to harry potter on tape &#8211; that&#8217;s why i see the movies, to get someone else&#8217;s version of the book, but sometimes i just want to hear the words in my head, in my voice, with my imagery &#8211; yup, sometimes it&#8217;s just all about me.)*

** (i&#8217;m always horrified to see knitters wearing those wrist braces &#8211; i understand often it&#8217;s a preventative thing, and that&#8217;s good, but still, man, that&#8217;s pretty extreme and i don&#8217;t want to go there. i&#8217;m convinced computers will get better because there&#8217;s just wayyyy too many people out there with already-long-term carpal tunnel syndrome issues, so that voice-recognition software will just get better and better and even, hopefully, replace mouse clicking and even typing at some point.) *
