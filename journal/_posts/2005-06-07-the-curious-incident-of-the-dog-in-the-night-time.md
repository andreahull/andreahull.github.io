## by Mark Haddon 

it took me a while to read this book, not because i didn&#8217;t like it, just it was too abstract in a way, too distant, and i was just too busy to give it the time it needed. once i stopped (and procrastinated) and gave it some serious reading time, i loved it and got pulled into christopher&#8217;s world. 

obviously there&#8217;s a lot of humor in this book, but what i loved were the puzzles and logic games &#8211; reminds me of when i was 11 and really into those mensa quiz books. we would go on long car rides and i&#8217;d try and figure them out, going cross-eyed from the effort.
