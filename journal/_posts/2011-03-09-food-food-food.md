i love to cook. the mood comes and goes somewhat, but generally i&#8217;m cooking something new up every month that i&#8217;m excited about. i&#8217;m bad at remembering to take pictures of the dishes but i can guarantee that each and every one of these recipes is delicious. approaching the end of this pregnancy, i&#8217;m looking to double up and freeze the half we don&#8217;t eat so that when the baby comes we won&#8217;t be starving and/or ordering take-out every *single* day. just maybe every other day. <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" />

the recipes:

~ bean and cheese enchiladas ~ i got this recipe originally from [pioneer woman ][1] and i&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s delicious as is, but i substituted cottage cheese for the sour cream, added in a can of refried beans, use whatever cheeses i can find (usually a gouda/edam mix), added a ton more cumin, and top with freshly diced tomatoes at the end. we like it a lot.

~ roasted vegetable lasagna ~ from [for the love of cooking][2]. i change up the vegetables to be whatever we find in the mercado that&#8217;s fresh and good-looking. basically i&#8217;ve learned you cannot go wrong with roasted vegetables. add pasta, cheese, and some spices, and it&#8217;s even harder to go wrong. i do like the no-bake lasagna pasta, but other than that, this takes a while to make (mostly just waiting for the veggies to roast, and stirring them every 15 minutes or so) and is very very worth it. 

~ cheese and potato tart ~ from [smitten kitchen][3]. to account for the altitude here (12,000+ ft!), i added an egg and some water to the crust and an egg yolk to the filling. the crust turns out really nice and crispy (not sure if that&#8217;s due to the ingredients or the silicone pie &#8216;pan&#8217; i use). i like blue cheese and roquefort is super popular here, but i usually have two different cheeses for those that don&#8217;t like blue cheese. emmantaler works great, but so would gruyere and probably any other melty cheese. 

~ spinach quiche ~ from [last one eating][4], which i got from my sister&#8217;s mother in law. she brought it over the day my sister came home from the birth center with her newborn (along with a very good [kale and two-bean soup][5]) and it was the perrrrfect food. iron-wise it&#8217;s super rich, which every woman needs after birth, it&#8217;s generally very healthy, plus it makes an enormous quiche that freezes very well. the only thing i&#8217;ll change is make a bit more dough since last time, i had to really thin it out to accept all the filling. i like my crusts.

~ cauliflower gratin with leeks and gruyere ~ from [cook&#8217;s illustrated][6]. this dish is very good ~ though again, how can you go wrong with the three simple ingredients listed above? of course, wash the leeks super thoroughly. i used sourdough instead of sandwich bread. hmm, what else ~ i don&#8217;t think it would hurt to have more cauliflower in there, there&#8217;s so much cheese. not that that&#8217;s a bad thing.

~ crispy hash browns ~ from [simply recipes][7] (love this site). easy to make! one large hash brown (say, 9&#8221; diameter) uses 3-4 potatoes so you can be eating in about 20 minutes max. i think these would freeze very very well. plus it&#8217;s lots of fun to flip them.

here&#8217;s some other recipes that aren&#8217;t too complicated or somewhat silly for an eight-month pregnant woman to contemplate (unlike my recently bookmarked [homemade ketchup][8] recipe):

~ [broccoli cheese casserole][9]

~ [spaghetti frittata][10] ~ i did make this once and it was quite good. great way to use leftover pasta, but that&#8217;s not really a problem in this house.

~ [cornbread][11] ~ this looks delicious. worried about the altitude part, i&#8217;ve put it off but one day i *will* tackle this.

by the way, my favorite way to find new recipes is using this custom google search somebody set up and i bookmarked forever ago: [foodblogsearch.com][12]. it does exactly what it says, searching over 3000 food blogs according to your criteria. it&#8217;s excellent. 

i have a little list of kitchen things i want (just got to scratch tongs off the list, yay for kitchen tongs. definitely helps with the enchilada recipe.) that includes a pressure cooker, a crock pot, a food processor, a pasta maker (sigh), and some nice cast-iron pots and pans. slowly but surely we&#8217;ll get them, and in the meantime there&#8217;s still so much good cooking that can be done.

and with that, now i&#8217;m hungry again! off to chug more water first, gotta stay hydrated. happy monday ~
