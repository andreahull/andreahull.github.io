<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="229" /></span>hello there! well, as you might have noticed, my secret pal revealed her name to me this weekend and she is none other but the fabulous glamorous sweet-as-can-be (but we already knew that, didn&#8217;t we? <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> ) kimberli of [www.kimberlinewyork.blogspot.com][1]! i still have two (ahhhh! TWO!! how exciting!) packages winging their way to me&#8212;one from new york, one from hong kong (she&#8217;s a busy traveling girl so *no wonder* i got packages from new york, california, and new york!) you all have seen the great goodies i&#8217;ve gotten from my secret pal as well as all the comments, but you haven&#8217;t seen the many sweet e-mails and just-at-the-right-moment e-cards that just made my day, so once again: THANK YOU KIMBERLI! as you would say &#8216;weeeeeeeeeeee!&#8217; <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> 

<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="230" /></span>*my* secret pal was also far away, but this time all the way over the atlantic ocean in belgium: anne-marie of [quemch.canalblog.com][2]! i just sent off anne-marie&#8217;s Last Package on saturday but it was a lot of fun packing up things to send to her, imagining her opening them up, and all that&#8212;though the first package, to my frustration, got sent *back* to me so for the first month all she got was a gift certificate from amazon (a last minute save, phew). 

in other news: as you can see, my branching out scarf is [complete][3]! i finished it this weekend watching some good movies and some not-so-good movies, including [nothing but a man][4] starring the beautiful abbey lincoln (a good movie), [clash of the titans][5] (i know it should be a bad movie, but i have childhood emotional ties to it <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> ), and [the seven year itch][6] (a bad movie! i was surprised but i thought it was really bad. marilyn monroe was beautiful but not so funny and really i much prefer [the misfits][7]).

mama cat gracefully posted for me&#8212;and my cat has style! notice the cocked ear! and such aloofness in her gaze&#8212;whatta model <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> the other picture is my attempt at close-up knitting pics like [sweet georgia][8] and many others do, but it&#8217;s not very good. (obviously i have to study up [burnt orange&#8217;s][9] tips on knitting photography!) and, yes, please don&#8217;t notice the cat hairs all over it.

though i found out about it a little late, there is a [branching out knit along blog][10] where people have posted their beautiful mohairs, silky wook, and more, finished objects. 

<span class="pic"><img src="http://mellowtrouble.net/images/knitalong_baby.jpg" /></span>*and* i&#8217;ve joined another knitalong, the [baby knitalong][11] so i can get my seriously neglected aunty duties on a move. i finally got that erika knight book out of the library and have been studying it for a few days now. thank goodness, i already have a stack of knitted dishclothes in white cotton done all ready.

<span class="pic"><img src="http://mellowtrouble.net/images/knitalong_knitterswithoutborders.jpg" /></span>oh, and lastly, since kimberli was such a great secret pal, i decided to support one of the charities she features on her blog, namely the [yarn harlot][12]&#8217;s [knitters without borders][13]. not only is this something i&#8217;ve been meaning to do for months now, but it&#8217;s a great way to sign yourself up for some potential yarn goodies later on. <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" />

hope your weekend was great ~ mine flew by but was overall very satisfying. have a great monday!
