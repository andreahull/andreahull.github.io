<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="776" /></span>i&#8217;m so proud, i love this demi-shawl. this is my second handspun knitted project, and the first that&#8217;s 100% spindle-spun. yay! it&#8217;s funny, i don&#8217;t like knitting with variegated yarn usually, but i absolutely love spinning it. and in this case, i agree with others, the simpler the lace stitch is, the better it works with variegated yarn. here, the feather and fan stitch worked beautifully, if i may say so myself. <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> aren&#8217;t the colors amazing? and that last pic is kinda crazy with its super-saturation but it does show the pretty lace pattern. 

i started out with the some [blue faced leicester roving][1], in the colourway &#8220;iris&#8221;, about 4 oz of it. this resulted in about 300 yards of yarn in mostly [dk weight][2]. <span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="778" /></span>i doubled up the yarn, cast on, and three days later had a finished scarf. it bled a bit in the water, but i threw in some vinegar in the second wash, so that helped. then i blocked it pretty strongly, going back every few hours to re-stretch and re-pin it. as a result, it grew from 30 inches long to over 42 inches! hence the change from scarf to demi-shawl, since it&#8217;s so wide and really feels nice around my shoulders. more pics and info on the [project page][3].

and that&#8217;s it. how satisfying! too bad it&#8217;s like 69 degrees outside. ah well, tomorrow it&#8217;s supposed to rain. good. 

off to class ~ first week of school and last night&#8217;s class on &#8220;preservation of heritage materials&#8221; was excellent. i even figured out a way to bring some fiber research into my final paper, and maybe even some spinning. whatever works, right?
