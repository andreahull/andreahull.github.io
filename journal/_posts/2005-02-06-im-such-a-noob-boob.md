[once again][1] [once again][2], i&#8217;m confounded and exasperated with my attempts at making a large comfy sweater.

i just finished the body section of [topsecret][3] and realized, horrors, that it&#8217;s too freaking small. i was on gauge, i swear i was, when i first started but this friggin&#8217; yarn is not fun to knit with and i guess my poor hand cramping up for days should have tipped me to [re-check my gauge][4]. but i didn&#8217;t. so this sweater, that is supposed to be easy for an advanced beginner is stumping me. and i hate that. 

how does it fit? well, i slid on the body section and it&#8217;s&#8230; body-hugging. if i pull at it a bit, it stretches out to what it should be, but&#8230; i don&#8217;t know about acrylic &#8211; does it bounce back? i have no idea and i&#8217;m sooo frustrated right now. i&#8217;m doing the medium size and so the bottom is supposed to be 42&#8221; and right where it will meet the arms it&#8217;s supposed to be 38&#8221; wide. well, what i&#8217;m getting is about 38&#8221; at the bottom and 34&#8221; at the top. way off. 

what should i do? i know if it&#8217;s at all body-hugging-ish i&#8217;m not going to wear it since the whole idea was to have a big sweater. but the idea of frogging that yarn&#8230; :shudder:. and then, if i do frog it, should i switch to larger needles or should i just knit a larger size? 

this weekend did not go as nicely as i hoped it would. and this, right now, feels like the straw that&#8217;s breaking this camel&#8217;s back. argh&#8230; one thing i can hope is that *sooner or later* i will learn to respect that crazy thing called &#8220;swatching&#8221; and understand it&#8217;s an ongoing thing until the sweater, or whatever, is complete. aghhhhh. 

screw it! i&#8217;m off to rent a movie and *not* deal with this right now.

update: did a ton of laundry, painted my nails, dyed my hair, and watched silly old movies. yeah, i feel a bit better now. g&#8217;night.
