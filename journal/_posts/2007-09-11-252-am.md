and i can&#8217;t get back to sleep. i came back, from a day at the paper studio, around 8, made some dinner (i.e. heated up frozen pizza while eating previously-addicting-now-a-tad-nauseating [i hate it when that happens] honey mustard pretzel bits), and then collapsed asleep a few minutes later. woke up with one arm above my head still asleep, and a steady rain on the skylights reminding me that i had some household chores to attend to, including feeding the various animals. finished that, got in bed, and still no sleep. i have that george harrison song in my head, [what is life][1], as it has been for days now off-and-on. 

i&#8217;ve been working at least six days out of every seven for the past two weeks, eight hour shifts at a time, besides entertaining guests, spending time with siblings and their families, and trying to not entirely ignore my sweet cats or have my room overtaken by dust bunnies (a battle i&#8217;m losing). i *definitely* overbooked and i still have another week &#8211; this week &#8211; to go before my schedule clears up to a much more manageable level. i like to be busy, and it&#8217;s very satisfying to be making money again(!), but i don&#8217;t like to be *this* busy where, if i *do* have a moment to chat and talk with friends and loved ones, i feel like the most boring person in the world. 

so. i found out my big plans for the weekend were canceled and i&#8217;m mostly relieved, which makes for a totally empty saturday and a largely empty sunday. ok, five hours of work on sunday, but i&#8217;ve come to realize there&#8217;s a *big* difference between a five-hour shift and an eight-hour one. i&#8217;m tempted to invite friends over or make plans with family, but i&#8217;m resisting my own silliness. my dad comes back on sunday night, so saturday&#8217;s my last and almost only day home alone. i&#8217;ve been largely happy while working &#8211; it&#8217;s good work, satisfying work, both at the paper place and the library gigs &#8211; but during my free time i&#8217;m often not, punctuated with little bits of laughter and excitement, as always, never fear. anyhow, i don&#8217;t know quite what that means &#8211; loneliness? habit? ..etcetc -, but i&#8217;m looking forward to some time to just chill out and sit in the sunshine. 

i made a table the other day though. and today i made a crucial piece of equipment much more sturdy. and the other day i helped a boy find some much-needed videos on the minoans and carthaginans. and over the weeks i&#8217;ve helped a good hanful of people learn some basic internet-use skills. and, also at the library, i talked to a little girl who charmingly explained that she wasn&#8217;t allowed to talk to strangers unless her dad was present and as she could *just* see the top of his head as he browsed the dvd stacks, it was quite o.k. to talk to me. there&#8217;s a lot to be said for having two great jobs that make you feel proud to be there. thank goodness.

lastly, for those still wondering, yes it&#8217;s linen and yes it&#8217;s a papermaking project. go merna for being the first to guess correctly! <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" />

hoping you have a good tuesday..

update: .. which i know i&#8217;ll have as i found out my shift today was canceled. or never placed, more precisely. but i don&#8217;t care, hooray hooray! 

update again: the shift was replaced with a five hour one. noo problemo. still leaves me time to get some things done (including the vet, a post office run, and some major vacuuming) as well as chill out and relax, though not in the sun as it&#8217;s a rainy day here in maryland.
