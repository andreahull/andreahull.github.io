this is just a sampling of 6 of my favorites, with another forty(!) on a [separate photos pages][1] for those that wish to live vicarously through me. hee.

i had about another 20 that were taken just in the church, as well as a bunch before the wedding when the bride was getting ready, but they were, ahem, erased accidentally by her brother after he decided he didn&#8217;t like a certain picture of himself. i almost throttled him to death but thought the bride might not like that. poor guy, he ran away soon after to escape my wrath.

two things to add: 1) i did not take enough people pictures. i never do, it&#8217;s a bad habit, i get all shy. 2) i don&#8217;t have a single photo of me in my dress that&#8217;s visible from head to toe. very bad of me, i know, i know!

update: it seems like it may indeed be a [bay][2] [fig][3], thank you very much paul bunyon (ahem). but what&#8217;s an australian tree doing in sicily?! although banyon trees are awesome, i don&#8217;t think this tree is one since banyon roots go [up][4] [up][5] [up][6] &#8212;wasn&#8217;t that the tree the swiss family robinson lived in? anyhow, trees rock. and so do my readers <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" />
