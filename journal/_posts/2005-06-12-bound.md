## by Donna Jo Napoli

a good read &#8211; not the best of her fairy tale adaptions, but still good. i liked that her boy calls her &#8216;the impertinent one&#8217; and she&#8217;s all sassy with him, but still it&#8217;s a cindererlla story and i just never liked cinderella, don&#8217;t know why. 

the description of the foot binding was gruesome and, probably, realistic, but still, i just feel like i see all this criticism about foot binding but soooo very little, if any, about corsets, for example, that european women used for centuries. in many cases, women broke *ribs* and even had ribs *removed* just to have small waists. now, that&#8217;s just as drastic in my book. i mean you have to *breathe*, you know? but i see so little criticism about it, much less creativity surrounding it, such as *bound* does with foot binding. 

i like that she&#8217;s not writing just about white women, that&#8217;s good, especially as there&#8217;s such a richness of non-european fairy tales to choose from when writing adaptations. but the foot-binding thing? not digging it, however well it fits into the whole cinderella story.
