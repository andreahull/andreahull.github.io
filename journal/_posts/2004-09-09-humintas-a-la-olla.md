humintas are delicious! they look like tamales but they&#8217;re better. i&#8217;ll try to remember to take pictures the next time i make them.

**Ingredients**

4 cups fresh ground corn  
1/4 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper, if desired  
1 cup butter  
1 cup boiling water

1 spoonful salt  
2 spoonfuls sugar  
5 fresh cheese (fresh mozzarella will work ok, but a soft farmer&#8217;s cheese works best)

1 teaspoon anise in grain  
enough corn husks to make 8 large humintas or 16 small ones

**Preparation**

&#187; Heat a large casserole over high heat. Add ground cayenne pepper with the water cup. Let it cook until the water has evaporated. Add the butter and let it cook for five minutes. As soon as the mixture boils, remove from heat and add it to the four cups of ground corn. Mix quickly and add sugar, salt, always stirring.

&#187; Add anise and cinnamon (if wanted, which you do).

&#187; Take two husks, join them by the wide parts. In the middle place one or two spoonfuls of the corn mixture with a slice of cheese. Close them by doubling first the husk on top and later the one at the bottom and finally the sides. Tie them using a string made of husks. Do the same with all.

&#187; In a large casserole put two rows of corn cobs covered with some husks. Add boiling water until covering the first row of cobs. Place the humintas on top and cover them again with husks. Let them cook over medium heat for forty-five minutes.

&#187; To know for sure when humintas are ready, cook a potato with them. When the potato is cooked, humintas also will be ready. Serve them hot.

(Serves 8)
