i am exhausted to the point that i feel like whenever i try and speak with anyone, what really comes out is a gibbering rant with constant head shaking and dizzy smiles. i remember vacya&#8217;s mom telling me once that she used to pull all-nighters when she was in grad school and her two sons were little tots but she knew that she just couldn&#8217;t do it now. that there was a definite point in her life when she **could** pull all-nighters and then something changed and now she just can&#8217;t. well, whatever causes that line to be drawn, i&#8217;m teetering on the edge of it. last night was the hardest single all-nighter i can ever remember pulling.

now, for those who knew me at bryn mawr, there **were** times when i was overwhelmingly exhausted, even more than right now, but that was after several night in a row of all-nighters. sigh. i&#8217;m getting older. and i like the grey hairs (of which i probably have a dozen or so! ay!) and i like feeling responsible and respectful and stuff. but i don&#8217;t like creaking knees or backs (which i sometimes get) or receiving funny looks because i remember watching yogi bear and hogan&#8217;s heros after school. and now, to that sad silly list, i can add the (almost) inability to pull all-nighters.

i have a short-ish paper due monday and a test on monday but at least that&#8217;s still more than 48 hours away.

nonetheless, life is sweet right now and i&#8217;m really trying to stop and appreciate where i am in life.
