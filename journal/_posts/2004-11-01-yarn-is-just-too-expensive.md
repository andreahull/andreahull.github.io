<span class="pic"><img src="http://mellowtrouble.net/images/22.jpg" alt="[he glows so prettily]" title="[he glows so prettily]" /></span>hi there ~ i had a fun halloween, and carved at the last minute a very nice pumpkin, i&#8217;ll try and post some pics later tonight. 

but now, a rant: how can anyone out there afford to make [rowan][1] after rowan knitted-things?! and throw in rebecca, [debbie bliss][2] and [phildar][3] stuff too. it&#8217;s all just way too expensive! there&#8217;s this truly beautiful debbie bliss [cardigan][4] over at [yummy yarn][5] and so, feeing overly optimistic about my knitting skills, i looked around for how much it would cost to buy the recommended yarn, debbie bliss&#8217; cotton angora. at about [$7.50 a skein][6], with 16 skeins needed, it would cost $120 just to buy the yarn, let alone the pattern, needles, and shipping! !!! really i just can&#8217;t type enough exclamation marks in there, those prices are just so outrageous! $120 for a cardigan, a beautiful <span class="pic"><img src="http://mellowtrouble.net/images/23.jpg" alt="[i love my jack-o-lantern]" title="[i love my jack-o-lantern]" /></span>high-quality one, but still just a cardigan! and the thing is, i see [blog][7] after [blog][8] of people knitting not only one rowan-caliber (price) project but several at a time, with galleries, archives and finished knit-a-longs filled with such projects! how do people do it?

this so sucks. knitting is starting to feel like something just for the uber-rich. i know, i could just knit with acrylics or basic wool (not even koigu or organic wool) and use patterns from <a href=:http://knitty.com">knitty</a> and [magknits][9] (and i *do* use them, and they&#8217;re great, don&#8217;t get me wrong) and stick to kintting stuff that doesn&#8217;t need more than 3 or 4 skeins at a time, but i don&#8217;t want to! and as much as i like bags and scarfs and hats, i want to knit some pretty, warm, double-digit-skein-requirement sweaters. and all the above mentioned companies have the prettiest, really truly the prettiest, patterns and yarn. argh.

rant finished, promise. now, i&#8217;m just sighing. silly me.
