i&#8217;m in my room, on my bed, typing away on the laptop, and i hear a loud scared &#8216;meooow&#8217;. i know mamacat is sitting next to me, because every once in a while, even though i&#8217;ve asked her for *years* now not to, she gives me a hesitant wet little lick on my arm. so sweet but so startling and distracting and.. annoying! but it&#8217;s love. anyhow, so then i&#8217;m about to call out trouble&#8217;s name when i hear my mom say in spanish, &#8216;are you lost, kitty? what are you doing in my kitchen!?!&#8217; trouble meows once more really loud, really lost, and i call out to her. a scramble of claws on the floor, up the stairs, into my room, up some more stairs, and a jump onto the bed.. here&#8217;s trouble, coming straight up to my face, tail waving all agitated. as soon as i pet her, a loud loud purr.
