      another retelling of the cinderlla fairy tale, but this time what happens after the &#8220;happily every after&#8221; begins? also, ella is astounded to hear in the whispers around the court and by the commoners about a fairy godmother and magic.

      a good book but ultimately, a little fast at the end? or maybe not <em>enough</em> of an ending? basically, it felt like a well thought out book until the last ten pages or so. still, interesting bits here and there and a nice story over all.
