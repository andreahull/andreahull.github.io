i love love this top! it was a quick and beautiful knit, and since it needed a little under two skeins of bernat&#8217;s cotton tots, it cost less than $7 &#8211; incredible!

thanks to [christine][1] for a wonderful pattern&#8212;she&#8217;s coming out with more in the near future and i&#8217;ll be sure to keep an eye out. for more detailed stats about laleh, go to my [project][2] page. photos by [yy][3].

in other news, i am picking up my long-awaited yarn today since the ups guy couldn&#8217;t get them to me at a reasonable hour (grrr) and on monday i finally received those phildar mags &#8211; beautiful patterns! but first, a loose-fitting v-neck sweater for me and (possibly) a clapotis for a friend of mine&#8217;s upcoming wedding.. in italy! hopefully some big news about *that* coming up soon too.
