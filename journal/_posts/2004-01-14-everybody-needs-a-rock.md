## by Byrd Baylor 

i bought this kid&#8217;s picture book when i was out in moab, utah this past summer for work. the drawings, by Peter Parnall, are gorgeous&#8212;simple and beautiful lines with low-contrast colors. 

i read it first in moab and just re-read it now, the story is good and easy for any age. the mood of this book reminds me of the smallest bits of beauty and intricacy found in nature, which i often forget about here in l.a.
