hi. happy belated may day. just a list for today of stuff i&#8217;ve been looking at recently, for whatever it&#8217;s worth:

</p> 

  * Â¤ [curiosity is bliss: http 101][1]


  * Â¤ [position and aligning using css][2]


  * Â¤ [vegan food guide][3]


  * Â¤ [women in american history][4]


  * Â¤ [mooncalendar][5]
  * Â¤ [stat counter, free and invisible][6]


  * Â¤ torture at abu ghraib</li> 
    
    
    
      * Â¤ [iraq coalition casualties][7]
    
    
      * Â¤ [nyc indymedia post on images of tortured iraqis][8]
    </ul> 
    
    it&#8217;s probably an indication of how messed up our (my) minds are that in this list it seems fine to see links to vegan food, calendars, and, also to horrible horrible photos and written details of torture being done in the name of u.s. people, with their (our) money, support (tacit or outright), and passivity. it&#8217;s just sick. i&#8217;m not making any sense, i know,
