~ spring break is over for me as of 9 am this morning. a moment of silence, please&#8230;&#8230;.

~ &#8220;Director John Hughes has announced that classic &#8216;80s movie Pretty In Pink is to get a sequel&#8230;. The sequel, which is planned for a 2006 release, will show fans what has changed for the characters now that their high school days are over. The movie&#8217;s original stars &#8211; Molly Ringwald, Andrew McCarthy and John Cryer &#8211; have all agreed to appear.&#8221; though not my favorite movie by all means, i still find this planned sequel very interesting since they&#8217;re using the same actors (though i agree with [others][1] in asking &#8216;what about james spader?!&#8217;). similarily the before/after sunset movies are interesting, though really ethan hawke looks downright scary in the posters for the newer movie. 

~ [yagoohoogle][2] lets you search google and yahoo at the same time, showing results from both search enginges side by side so you can compare them [via [sites&soundbytes][3]]. i was never a big fan of yahoo (before google, i was a big altavista user) but i love the whole idea of comparing results.

~ [wiseneedle]() turns [ten][4] today! wiseneedle is a great resources for all knitters and totally need to be supported and added to more by all, including me. not only does it have a remarkably high number of yarn reviews )so helpful in figuring out substitution yarns specifically) but also [the international glossary of knitting terms][5]. this will definitely come in handy with some phildar (i.e. french!) patterns i&#8217;ve been contemplating. 

~ if you haven&#8217;t checked out google&#8217;s maps, now might be a fun time. or maybe not so fun, i haven&#8217;t decided. the big deal is that their maps can now be viewed as satellite images rather than cartoony street maps &#8211; for example, here&#8217;s my [alma mater][6]. the detail is incredible, though limited to the u.s. for now, i believe. a little creepy, <span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="209" /></span>  
but if the government has these (and better, i&#8217;m sure, and for years now, too), then we might as well make it public for us all to use, right? 

~ the pics in this post are just a silly web thing i&#8217;ve been seeing on a few blogs. go to [netdisaster.com][7] and see what your website would look like if.. well, in my case, a dinosaur walks all over my journal and then later my lovely journal gets mistaken for a hot pan. there&#8217;s all kind of natural and human-made disasters to choose from &#8211; totally silly, but amusing.

<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="210" /></span>~ italy italy! a friend of mine is getting married next thursday, the 14th of april. at the very last minute, i decided i have to be there for the wedding! (i mean, really, who can resist a bride?) very exciting and you can be darn sure i&#8217;ll post photos galore. for one, she&#8217;s getting married in the [cathedral][8] in palermo, a gorgeous example (especially inside, i&#8217;ve been told) of sicilian architecture, with its french, spanish, and moorish influences. ay, i can&#8217;t wait!
