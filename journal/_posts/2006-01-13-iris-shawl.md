finished: january 12, 2006  
pattern: [feather and fan scarf][1] from wendy d. johnson  
yarn: my own spindle-spun yarn! 

this was a quick spin and knit, all done in under a week. i bought some blue faced leicester roving from janel of [chameleon colorworks][2] at the [local spinning guild][3]&#8217;s monthly meeting. about 4 oz worth, the colors were an amzing combo of purples and lime greens in a colourway called &#8220;iris&#8221;. having no wheel, sigh, i just couldn&#8217;t resist spinning the roving immediately, even if it was on a spindle (sorry, i like spindles, but i *love* wheels!). i got about 300 yards worth of mostly dk weight yarn. 

after sufficient fondling of the yarn, i made a giant cake of it using my new swift and ballwinder and, doubling up on the yarn &#8211; easy to do if you have a cake &#8211; i immediately cast on for the feather and fan scarf. about three days later, i was done, and worried that it would be much too short to be anything besides a simple neckwarmer. 

behold the power of blocking: from 30 inches to over 42! perfect. now, it drapes prettily on my shoulders and is definitely shawl-ish. i blocked it really hard, re-pinning every few hours and stretching it as much as i could. 

all in all, i love this iris shawl! it&#8217;s beeyouteeful, and i&#8217;m so fascinated by the different colors and knowing ha! i made it all by myself. very cool.
