hello~

thank goodness for the holidays. tomorrow i would normally have seven hours of class (yikes) but instead i will relax..and spend all day writing my first paper of the quarater. it&#8217;s a biggie though and i have yet to start. argh.

i had a beautiful valentine&#8217;s day yesterday. usually, actually always, [i don&#8217;t celebrate valentines][1]. and i didn&#8217;t think that this year would be any different. but it just was a really great day. very emotional, i was uppppp and dowwwwnnn. i don&#8217;t know why, just real weepy. vacya and i went out to eat (a last-minute plan) and then got out some movies from our favorite video place, [vidiots][2], and we ended up watching one of them when we got back. it was [fidel][3], a documentary that came out last year by estela bravo, and it was so good! fidel looked a lot like an old boyfriend of mine (milian. does anyone else see that? it was vacya that pointed it out to me.) which weirded me out a bit, but by the end i just thought fidel seemed liked such a nice guy. and really unusual in that he is still alive. 

i had a delicious [borscht fest][4] with caroline and maria on friday night and that was really fun. i made the borscht the night before, which relieved a ton of the normal last-minute jitters/clean-up that i usually have. as it was i was glad to have dim lighting (thanks to the christmas lights i will never take down) to mask all the dust bunnies. i love hanging out with maria and caroline..

this morning i played around with my digital camera a bit. it can also take short little quicktime movies so i shot one of trouble, and later mama cat, sitting in the sunlight in front of the window. [click here to see it][5].

oh and that picture in the top right corner is me with bangs! in case you didn&#8217;t read already (see [here][6]), i banged myself on the 8th and i&#8217;m reallllly happy about it.

well, off to watch the second movie we got out ([canadian bacon][7] by [michael moore][8]. it was the last film john candy was in before he died. it looks great. update: funny but not really good. but funny!)

found a weird game but really fun called [opinyama][9]. and, last but not least, the dork that i am found really cool (though definitely old) image maps from satellites that allow you to zoom in and find where you live, like [these][10]. cool.
