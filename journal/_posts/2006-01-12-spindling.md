hi there ~ not too thrilled today, but at least there&#8217;s interesting things going on, such as the roving i got this past weekend at the spinning guild meeting. it&#8217;s dyed by janel, a member and the editor of [spindlicity][1], and isn&#8217;t it beautiful? 

<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="775" /></span>yarn was created, about 300 yards. considering i don&#8217;t do much spindle spinning, i was really happy with how the yarn turned out and it was largely consistent though they were some big old thick and thin bits. as soon as i finished spinning, i wound it into cakes using my new swift and ballwinder (yay) and then immediately cast on for a simple [feather and fan scarf][2]. i just finished it this morning but it&#8217;s blocking so i&#8217;ll post more info and pics of it tomorrow. i&#8217;m definitely pleased with it, gotta say. 

now, some memes, one passed on to me by [heidi][3] and another i lifted from [susan][4]. heidi&#8217;s is similar to one i&#8217;ve done before, so i slightly modified it for fun..

What were you doing 10 years ago?  
i was living in italy with my older sister daniella in [perugia][9], a beautiful city near florence. we were going out every night to clubs and dancing our butts off. i was really sad over a boy, but, thanks to my sister, usually too distracted to do anything but sigh now and then. i was getting into italian comic books and cheesy 70s italian music and, though missing home, really loving my life. and my sister! we still talk to each other in italian, and thanks to that time, we&#8217;ll always always be super close and just bonded, you know? sigh, love ya, bella!

What were you doing 1 year ago?  
hmm, let&#8217;s see.. i had [just finished][10] my first sweater the day before and that night i would be stuck browsing the internet till late late at night and [tomorrow][11], a year ago, i would be cranky, with unpacked holiday luggage, late library books, and feeling blah. huh, whaddya know, sounds a lot like today. ack.

What were you doing 1 hour ago?  
i was re-pinning my scarf &#8211; boy lace stratches a llllllott. that&#8217;s satisfying. i was also drinking hot cocoa with marshmellows in it. one nice thing about having hot water that can scald you in a second is that you don&#8217;t really have to boil water for hot cocoa or tea anymore. 

Five creative things you want to achieve this year.  
get more [flexible][12] and [strong][13] (hey, that&#8217;s creative for me! swear it.)  
[dye][14] [well][15] and often  
be able to spin [lots][16] [of types][17] [of yarn][18]  
[cook][19] some fantastic meals for friends  
[grow][20] something besides my aloe and african violets  
and, #6, [write ][21] [more][22].

Five snacks you enjoy  
anything with cheese  
anything sour and gummy  
applesauce  
bread dipped in balsamic vinegar and olive oil, yum  
crunchy stuff, like trisqits and croutons and frosted sugar flakes

Five things you would do if money were no object  
buy a big old farm in vermont or in the mountains of north carolina  
go skiing and scuba diving often (i used to do both but haven&#8217;t in a long time), and drag my family along  
hire physical trainer and nutritionist who would be just the right amounts of not pushy but encouraging, not too touchy-feely but just cool, etc etc  
quit all my jobs  
give a lot of this no-object money to friends and family, so they could do the same

Five bad habits  
biting my nails  
latelate night eating (like 2 am!)  
accumulating fines, sigh  
forgetting/repressing things  
a tad flakey, ok, sometimes very very flakey, ugh  
see meme #2 below

Five things you like doing  
cleaning dishes (but i *hate* drying them, ugh)  
creating things with my hands  
making people laugh  
taking showers (but i hate the feeling of my wet hair on my shoulders, shudder)  
kissing

Three new things from this past year that you&#8217;re proud of  
spinning!  
quitting a job. nerve-wracking but once done, oh the relief!  
becoming more social at parties, not just hiding myself with those i&#8217;m super-close with. who knows if that&#8217;ll last, but lately, it&#8217;s been really true.

One thing you really like about yourself  
hmm, it&#8217;s a sad thing that this was really hard to think of. umm, i guess.. i guess it would be my ability to make a comfy place to live. i&#8217;m really good at that, my place rocks. it&#8217;s dirty, but nonetheless, hands-down, a great space. 

ok, and meme #2..

Five guilty pleasures:

~ **solitaire/mindsweeper/tetris** on my computer: i remember in college, my roommate was just bewildered by my mindsweeper obsession, but really sometimes i just want to escape escape, and this is a very easy way..

~ **cheesy fiction**, both of the romance and mystery variety. very very guilty. tied up with my catholic prudishness, i know. but sometimes i just want to feel like those kind of simplistic lives are possible, so escape i go.

~ **weird food combos**, like rice/parmesan/ketchup all mied together, or cheese on crackers alternated with pudding every other bite. i love texture variations in food, like popcorn and ice cream, yum.

~ **cheesy music**, especially some 70s pop &#8211; like [bread][23] and abba &#8211; and some disco, etc etc. stop groaning. i can&#8217;t help it, my foot starts tapping and i&#8217;m a goner.

~ **some reality shows**, like wifeswap and, especially, all the various nanny shows. &#8220;that is unacceptable!&#8221;

hmm, no tags here, please take one, or both!, if you want. that&#8217;s it for now, happy day to you and yours ~ ~
