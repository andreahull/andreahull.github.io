wow! had to add: i just saw a pair of enormous birds in the backyard! i can&#8217;t tell if they&#8217;re hawks or eagles, but they&#8217;re <span class="caps">BIG</span> and just gorgeous. i&#8217;d been hearing them for a while but didn&#8217;t think anything beyond, &#8220;huh, those are some noisy birds&#8221; and then one landed on the deck..! i ran for the camera but they had retreated to the woods already. one keeps calling out distressed-sounding yells, but they both seem to be flying fine and not hurt. i wish i knew more about what kind of birds they are &#8211; i wish i could help! but maybe they&#8217;re just happy it&#8217;s spring and yelling out about that. ! so very exciting, as you can tell by the exclamation marks. love the birds! 

now i have another thing to add to my dream-house list: trees tall enough to attract big birds. <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" />

here&#8217;s a list i&#8217;ve been putting together for a while now, with a focus of course on fiber and book studies. i&#8217;m not wanting to go back to school anytime soon, but some of the work/study opportunities look particularly tempting. 

anyhow, i split it into degree programs vs. workshops/extended programs. the degree programs are usually a 2+ year commitment. the workshops/extended programs are usually a few days long, a few weeks, or at most a summer-long commitment.
