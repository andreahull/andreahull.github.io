what a revelation! considering necessity, mother of invention, and all that, here&#8217;s my long-suffering laceleaf sweater finally finished up and happily worn. i&#8217;ll get project info up later tonight..

two detailed shots, one artsy-fartsy photo that came out like that &#8211; i really like how magicky it looks <del>, and one brrrr-it-really</del>*is*-cold (i keep being surprised by that!) photo. i love this sweater. it was a pretty simple knit, i just dragged my heels about it for far too long. now, you can&#8217;t take it off me.

tomorrow they&#8217;re predicting snow ~ crossing my fingers for more than flurries. happy winter ~
