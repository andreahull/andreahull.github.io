ok, ok, so i didn&#8217;t exactly get rid of any jeans or pants. yup, after all that moaning and groaning and clutching my head in grief (whilst typing) , i chickened out and knitted instead. (i wish the past tense of kintting was knat. fun to say and even more fun to type.) 

but oh what a knit! thanks to [amanda][1], who recommended a very nice poncho (called [paris loop][2]), i am a happy five-inches-done-so-far knitter again. in italy i tried to knit but it was too darn pretty outside and besides i had my sisters&#8217; butts to kick in uno. anyhow, i am back to knitting and oh i love it. i&#8217;m still not fast enough to say the yarn is just knitting itself up or anything like that, but i can say that now i see the beauty of nylon! and not just any nylon, but &#8216;supersoft fleecy nylon&#8217;. at [unwind][3], i stumbled on this great line of yarn called [poof][4] (from the great site [straw.com][5]) and i was immediately in deep like, if not love. i chose the natural white #0204 and i love it! so soft and amazingly fluffy. i can&#8217;t wait to finish this project o&#8217; mine. 

two good links: [lots of free poncho patterns][6] and [soysilk.com][7], really pretty yarn (made &#8220;from the waste of the Tofu Manufacturing process&#8221;! or others made from corn, or milk, or bamboo!) with nice patterns too.

oh! i finally got my yarn for knitting-up [hush][8], yay! also, i ordered that great phildar tendances 2004 from [knit n tyme][9], but when i got back and checked my mail, they had sent the 2003 issue! sux. so i called and emailed them and within hours a nice woman contacted me saying i could keep the 2003 one and that the 2004 issue was on its way to me. double yay and cross out the sux! needless to say, i&#8217;ll be ordering from them in the future. my stash groweth. yikes.

during my trip in italy i received some interesting news: people actually read my postings here. yup, people like mirko and lucinda in particular. and i know of others that read too but never no never never post a single comment. i&#8217;m hurt. really. they know all this super-secret stuff about me (though posted on the information superhighway, it still feels kinda private. impossible, really, i know.) but just lurk like big weirdos. and they know me, i like big weridos! so: luci, say hi once in a while, where are your manners? ha ;P. e mirko devi scrivere un messagio ogni tanto, click il comment e srcrivemi qualcosa, dai. (e no ho dimenticato le foto, le sto sviluppando adesso. ciao!)

ok, with that little castigating out of the way, i am feeling hungry right now. what should i get: subway&#8217;s veggie delites or poquito mas&#8217; veggie tacos?
