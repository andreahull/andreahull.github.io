<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="1233" /></span>someone i love very much is really sick &#8211; and i don&#8217;t want to share more than that for now &#8211; but that has translated into me knitting a lot and a lot these last few weeks and so, i have a whole bunch of projects to share.. 

<span class="picl"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="1235" /></span>it&#8217;s amazing how much knitting can help when life is hard. i think it&#8217;s something about the combination of a) creating something, which always requires, to be successful, a little something that is uniquely you, of b) letting the rhythm of the knitting take over, helping you to escape the problems of the day for a bit, and also of c) the very real and tangible warmth that sits in your lap, a surprisingly solid comfort. and of course there&#8217;s always the satisfaction that comes from being productive in the face of bad times, a small but powerful f\***you to bad luck and unfairness that happens to all of us at one time or another. <span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="1234" /></span>

so, here i have a finished [juliet][1] that just needs some button changearounds &#8211; i want two and they need to hold the garment tighter. then, pictured below, a [tilted duster][2] that was knit up in about a week that just needs some buttons. <span class="picl"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="1232" /></span>i included three pics to show the power of blocking &#8211; be it by steam (which i did for the ribbing) or by water (which i did too, because i&#8217;m kinda picky). and just look how different the yarn looks in each photo &#8211; so, ok, add the power of exposure when taking a picture. my [rogue][3] just requires some seaming of the sleeves, sewing up the hems, and weaving in the ends. i&#8217;m not super pleased with how the uneven stockinette in the very front (of course!) looks even after blocking, but whatever. after buying some size 1s and 0s (!) for the [poetry in stitches][4] kit, i&#8217;m back to working on the [lice sweater][5] (which needs a better name). and last but definitely not least, i started this really cute and comfy [shawl collar jumper][6] (though they call it a tunic, i like [jumper][7] better) from the fall vk using patons classic wool merino. first time i&#8217;m using the yarn, and even with just the swatching, i&#8217;m super impressed with the yarn &#8211; incredible yardage, nice colors, good price, easy availability, and on top of all that, surprisingly soft and drapey. i never realized what a loose knitter i am though. instead of the recommended size 5s, i had to go down to 2s. yikes. (btw, more info on [ravelry][8], of course)
