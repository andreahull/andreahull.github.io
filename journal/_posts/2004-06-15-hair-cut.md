hello. i&#8217;m not planning on getting any sleep tonight since i had 1)one paper due 5 hours ago, 2)a meeting in 10 hours to finalize a group project, and 3)one paper due 20 hours from now (really, it&#8217;s due thursday, not wednesday night, but i won&#8217;t be around thursday, sux). but, with good food and beautiful music (thanks to vacya) and this fast great computer, i plan to have all three done within the next 24 hours. yikes.

so, a few weeks ago, in a stupid rage, i chopped off a whole lot of hair. in this picture i look happy, but only after a couple days of much unhappiness and after vacya explained that i didn&#8217;t have to comb my hair back (a la superman) but could comb it forward, looking less like a combo between patrick swayzee and brigitte nielson. (btw, there&#8217;s a very good reason this picture is so dark.) i still feel really stupid for having chopped it off, not because i don&#8217;t like short hair but rather because i was really into having long-ish curly-wavy hair and was looking forward to the next planned phase. so, now i wait, again. it&#8217;ll take a good year to get back to what it was before my five minute freak-out. in the meantime, just call me bedhead.

i&#8217;ll post more later, hopefully with a link to my first paper, if i&#8217;m proud of it, which remains to be seen,  
**update 5/16/04:** ok, here it is: [Accessibility For The Print-Disabled Using <span class="caps">XML</span>][1] ~ i *am* pretty proud of it though i know the writing is awfully shaky (and just awful in some parts, especially at the end where i felt like i should just give in to the preacher-mode and write &#8216;hallelujah! the day will come!&#8217;) but i feel like i learned a lot. and that i always like. the second project was done as of this morning at ten am, phew. and now, final number three. yikes. we&#8217;ll see.

**more of an update 5/19/04:**my mom grabbed me and took me hostage.. off to puerto vallarta for three days, where my tia yvonne and supre-great cousin maria jose met up with us. the weather is incredibly hot, and of course, whitey that i am, i burned my shoulders and chest to a crisp and am in constant agony, but am eating a lot of cheese and talking and laughing for hours. very surreal to be here and not there, suffering with papers. but i&#8217;ll be back sunday night with my last paper turned in monday morning. and then! and then! my summer starts &#8212; ahh, i can&#8217;t wait. *though right now is pretty sweet, too, i must say. <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" class="wp-smiley" /> *
