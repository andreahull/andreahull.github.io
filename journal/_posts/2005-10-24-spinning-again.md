on friday, after two strong emails to various spinning enablers all about how i was going to wait to get a wheel, or even rent a wheel, later that day, during lunch i drove up and rented a majacraft rose. so pretty! and a little more tricky than the ashford traveller but ultimately, i&#8217;m sure it&#8217;ll be more satisfying. why am i not positive now? because my brother, out of the blue, came to visit me this weekend and we did the following:

  * ~ went to west coast choppers &#8211; he&#8217;s a motorcycle buff
  * ~ gambling at the bicycle casino, learned blackjack
  * ~ saw paul reiser standing at mall
  * ~ saw semi-naked photo shoot at beverly hills sign
  * ~ suffered through l.a traffic
  * ~ cruised sunset strip
  * ~ ate pupusas at salvadoreno restaurant
  * ~ went to a comedy show &#8211; harland williams at the improv
  * ~ marcus bought some cigars first
  * ~ i had a key lime pie martini, delish
  * ~ breakfast in the valley, overheard movie execs
  * ~ saw where i work and sat in a recording booth
  * ~ saw the hollywood sign through the fog and a bunch of &#8216;stars&#8217; on the sidewalk
  * ~ stood in front of graumann&#8217;s chinese theater
  * ~ bought some souvenirs for the family
  * ~ watched surfers waiting for some waves at topanga beach
  * ~ saw another model shoot
  * ~ drove around rodeo drive
  * ~ went to muscle beach &#8211; no muscle today
  * ~ walked around the venice boardwalk
  * ~ saw a movie shoot &#8211; don&#8217;t know which movie
  * ~ played around on bars and hoops
  * ~ watched skaters bopping around, dancing
  * ~ watched a drum circle
  * ~ went to a hockey game &#8211; the kings lost
  * ~ woke up very early to get to the airport

(the smart guy that he is, he saw and did more in 48 hours than a lot of people do in a week of visiting l.a.) so, now i need a weekend to recover from my weekend. and i need some wheel time, it&#8217;s just been sitting there all neglected. there was no knitting either &#8211; i asked my brother about bringing some to the hockey game and he just stared at me as if i had grown a second head.

so [this][1] is how that crazy fun yarn is made.

silk spinning [explained][2], with pictures

[MJ][3] pointed out some [beautiful wintery hat kits][4] that i&#8217;m a-thinkin&#8217; about. 

there&#8217;s so many crafts i want to dabble in, like screen printing. i&#8217;ve done a bit but this [cheap screen printing tutorial][5] makes it seem much more do-able.

[felted pumpkins][6] are also on my mind &#8211; though what to do with them later..?! it&#8217;d be cool to make them hollow somehow, to put candy in or something like that..

for itunes users, i&#8217;m trying to figure out [how to manage multiple libraries][7] &#8211; success or failure to be announced soon-ish

i&#8217;m thinking ahead to new projects. i have probably four different works-in-progress, but i just don&#8217;t feel a zip of motivation about them. so, in the meantime, i&#8217;m making a plan. first:

  * ~ <strike>finish vogue cabled sweater &#8211; only need an inch of ribbing!</strike>
  * ~ SYNO scarf! major priority. major major.
  * ~ then! breathe. 
  * ~ lace-leaf pullover. inspired by [winnie][8]&#8217;s beautiful one, i got some [rowan polar][9] (similar weight, gauge, content) in &#8216;silver lining&#8217;, which i&#8217;m hoping is a very very light blue. 
  * ~ and, rogue! on the horizon. finally bought the pattern and am currently trying to decide what color in [bartlett&#8217;s 2-ply][10] palette to choose from.. leaning towards [natural ][11] [earth colors][12]. hm. 
  * ~ rowan&#8217;s butterfly, the dress version. after seeing <a herf="http://seeeunnyknit.blogspot.com/2005/10/papillon.html">eunny</a>&#8217;s version using [jagger spun zephyr][13], i&#8217;ve decided to forgo the kidsilk haze, especially since i never like halos on me much anyhow. still trying to figure out the color on this one too.
  * ~ finally use up that beautiful heavy chunky cotton using [either on-line][14] [raglan pattern][15].

theoretically, also on the list:

  * ~ last other baby yellow-and-white hoodies
  * ~ crazy beautiful lace top from IK a while back
  * ~ frog and re-knit the bevin too
  * ~ possibly undo bottom of tammy sweater, knit a few inches, and then graft the two together? obviously, needs more thought.
  * ~ uuf, the two phildar top waiting not-so-patiently. !

a verrrrry long post with zip pictures. sorry. i&#8217;m still under this dark evil mood cloud i&#8217;ve been under for weeks now. the kind that makes me want to be (or at least feels it&#8217;s inevitable so why not accept it) a hermit at the edge of the woods and become very bitter and spit at people as they pass. sux. but, hope some of this was interesting nonetheless &#8211; the creativity of people and beauty in the world are what keep me inspired and hopeful for some chance of meaning & beauty in some parts of my life at least. so, keep on keepin&#8217; on, ok.

p.s. have you ever wondered [why it&#8217;s always windy in autumn?][16] this kind of question, the answers that follow, and the [sites][17] that [promote][18] them make the info-crazy in me happy.
