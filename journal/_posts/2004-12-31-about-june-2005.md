hi. i&#8217;m andrea hull, a moody, vegetarian, polyglot, pisces, 28 year old, middle child, introvert, 5&#8217;3&#8221; bibliophile.

i&#8217;m also a grad student at the [department of information studies][1] at [ucla][2]. i&#8217;m taking it slowly so as not to stress out too much as well as hopefully learn as much as possible &#8211; in other words, i&#8217;m not graduating this year and instead it&#8217;ll probably be next spring until i&#8217;m done. 

since november 2002 i&#8217;ve been working at the [pacifica radio archives][3] in different capacities and constantly changing schedules. this spring, i was finally officially hire to be the assistant cataloger, which mean i&#8217;m the unofifical webmaster, doing odds and ends cataloging (especially of [democracy now!][4], pacifica&#8217;s flagship program), as well as a whole lot of researching, organizing and assisting in lots of different projects and grant work. 

when not working or at school, you&#8217;ll find me home sweet home! home is a teeny apartment in koreatown with a loud street just outside my windows, bad pipes, and faulty electricity, but i love it. home is also sometimes maryland, just a few miles from the potomac river (that&#8217;s where i grew up and all my family is still there).

i used to be pretty involved in activist stuff, but since starting school this past year, and even before, once i moved into this apartment by myself, i pretty much dropped all the other groups and meetings. i feel a little guilty sometimes but mostly i&#8217;m glad to be done with the tedious meetings, annoying pontificating jerks, paranoia, socially-inbred cliques, and overall failure to really accomplish anything (the one exception: [la food not bombs][5]).

i love to read, eat carbs and grease, shower, play with my cats, dress up, go to sleep, play with little kids, make stuff, and laugh. i&#8217;m not very good at being happy on a regular basis, expressing myself beyond simplicities, reading non-fiction, keeping to to-do lists, excercising regularly, keeping in touch, or keeping my temper. i&#8217;m also a pretty agressive driver, i&#8217;m afraid ~ all my repressed anger just bubbles up and i start cussing and feeling really competitive. also, i always have lots of library fines and am overall a pretty dirty person. but, though this may seem a contradiction, i think i am getting better and better all the time (knock on wood). 

a great philosophy: &#8220;first, do no harm.&#8221;
