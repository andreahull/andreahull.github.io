hello.

had a beautiful weekend so far & it&#8217;s only saturday night&#8212;i definitely feel i&#8217;m in a transition stage & so far it&#8217;s extremely peaceful & exciting. the library is soon to close so i don&#8217;t want to forget to check out [this ][1]{.norm} page of the rant collective page.. also, [anarchism in action: methods, tactics, skills, and ideas][2]{.norm} looks promising.. importantly, i bought a set of tarot cards this weekend & really feel so positive about that decision i can&#8217;t quite believe my luck {thanks maria}&#8212;spent several hours this morning with my best friend doing readings and am positively in love with this magic. (they&#8217;re the [the mini motherpeace][3]{.norm} ones)  
busy busy as always&#8212;tomorrow work & more work&#8212;also, ucla talk i want to go to&#8230; ay

bye, andrea
