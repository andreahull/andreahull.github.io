finished: june 4, 2005  
pattern: [one skein wonder][1] by stefanie japel  
yarn: under half a skein of bernat&#8217;s cotton tots, in lilac  
needles: size 8s and 5s circs, using my denise needles

this was the first time i [knat][2] with my denise needles and i was not disappointed. though i prefer bamboo needles, at least in my mind, my hands were entirely happy with the denises. also, they&#8217;re perfect for a project like this, where you switch back and forth between very different sizes &#8211; it&#8217;s easy as pie with the denise set. ( i feel like a commercial or something, but it&#8217;s true!) 

i love this shrug &#8211; and i plan on making more, for my sisters particularly i&#8217;m thinking. picking up stitches isn&#8217;t fun, and i think i&#8217;ll go up a size next time, for a slightly looser hug instead of this firm (albeit comforting) hug i got going now. 

oh, this was a maybe five hour knit, very fast. i didn&#8217;t bother to block, and i still won&#8217;t, i don&#8217;t think &#8211; it fits fine and i love the look.
