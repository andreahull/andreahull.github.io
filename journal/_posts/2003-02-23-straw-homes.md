hello.

feeling pretty good right now even though i&#8217;ve been basically overwhelmed & underslept recently. i really need to find some balance in my life- starting with my living situation. seems like i&#8217;ve been unstable living-wise for years & years now. but&#8230;. i love the things i study & am learning & am thinking about when i have time- there&#8217;s too much to do & see & i want to learn it all! i&#8217;ve become a firm believer in lists, too! priority lists, favorite lists, wish lists, problem lists, long-term lists, calenders (which are basically lists), etc etc. recent favorites: prioritized projects that need some $$ (only to be started once i have 1)fixed my car, 2)saved up &#8216;emergency rent money fund&#8217;) & places/things i want to go to in the next ten months. here&#8217;s one for the last lovely list: the [Build Here Now Conference][1]{.norm}

bye, andrea
