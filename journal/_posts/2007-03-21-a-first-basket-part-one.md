<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="1109" /></span>i&#8217;ve been meaning to post about this project for a while but since i took so many pictures along the way, it was a little overwhelming trying to figure out what and how to present it all, hence the part one bit above. this was my first try at basketry, and i gotta say it was awesome. 

random bits: i made the basket in two days &#8211; one night lasting about seven hours and the next morning for about an hour &#8211; but now i know it can definitely be done in stages and not all at once; got the kit from the earth guild in asheville, nc &#8211; there were other choices, but the quality of reed matters a lot; also, there&#8217;s lots of leftover reed and i had so much leftover dye, i ended up dyeing a long-suffering knit <acronym title="work in progress">wip</acronym> to happy results. 

i&#8217;m off to organize my room, catch up on emails, and finally confront my long long to-do list. first i need to make myself comfy, i.e. put good music on, burn some incense, make sure the cats are happy, and get myself a tall glass of water. then, it&#8217;s time to work. good wednesday to you ~ ~

update: i got [the field basket kit][1], but almost all of the <span class="caps">ACP</span> kits appealed. there&#8217;s lot of good basketry books too.. i&#8217;ll try and get them together and write up a literature review, so to speak.
