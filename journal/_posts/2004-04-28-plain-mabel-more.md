hi.

today just hasn&#8217;t been a good day and i&#8217;m trying to figure out why. not a bad day, just a blah day. with a little bad tinging the edges. partially, that has to do with my loads of laundry literally stinking up my apartment. (sorry, that&#8217;s gross. but too true.) also, with this recent l.a. heatwave, my hair is frizzing in it&#8217;s biggest bloom yet&#8230; there are probably other little nothings nagging me, but i&#8217;m too lazy to think of them.

ok. that&#8217;s the end of that whining. promise. for today, at least. argh!

i really love [plain mabel][1]. it&#8217;s just a great creative site and one day, when i&#8217;m racking my brain trying to think of a cool present to make for a friend, i just know i&#8217;ll cry triumphant and rush to plain mabel and save my poor fingers from any needless work. (sorry for all the fancy writing. my brain is in a knot right now.) anyhow, i love looking at plain mabel&#8217;s stuff, it makes me feel all creative. oh, and ditto for [pashupatina][2].

this weekend, vacya and i tried to figure out why the fridge needed defrosting literally every two weeks. using [this site][3] and [this one][4], we figured out what was wrong, replaced one part and ordered another, due to arrive this weekend. yippee! i felt so proud, it was fun taking the fridge apart and now i just like to open it and feel all the cold air come rushing out.

oh! i finally got the rss thing to work. now, as soon as i post something new, it works like it&#8217;s supposed to, and updates the rss almost automatically (i hate cutting and pasting so this is a big improvement). so, [syndicate away][5], if you wish. it was a little tricky since i&#8217;m not using any cms or anything, it&#8217;s all basically home-made, but i found [this handy script][6] that generates xml from a php/mysql setup, which is what i&#8217;ve got. and it worked like a charm.

i like the way [mooshi][7] looks. the writing is funny too, but sharper than the way i write, i think. and i really like the [menu du jour][8] section in the lower right hand corner. pretty and so delicious sounding. i like minimalist sites a lot, but it&#8217;s hard for me to be so elegant. i&#8217;m a cluttered mind, and naturally jumpy, in a good way most of the time, so i can only admire the clean look. thank goodness i also like the jumbled baroque look, though this site is much cleaner-looking than my apartment, notebooks, desk at work, car, you get the idea.

~ i&#8217;m tired, and i still have some school work to do for tomorrow, &#8216;ta,

andrea
