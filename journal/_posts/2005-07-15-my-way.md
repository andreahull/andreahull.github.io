<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="309" /></span>hey there ~

pictures from hanging out with my sisters are [up][1] &#8211; leave a comment here if you like them. shoot, leave a comment anyhow! i&#8217;m sending a link to this post to my sisters in a attempt to get them to start blogging, so i want them to see the power &#8211; and addictive tendencies! &#8211; of blogging. and yes, that&#8217;s a lot of makeup on my face, i know, it was totally fun.

i&#8217;m plying like crazy &#8211; hence the pic (from left to right: my first drop spindled singles, my first wheel-spun singles, and then my pride and job, my first wheel-spun 2-ply skein &#8211; i&#8217;m such a proud mama.) and boy do i love the internet, so much great content for free. here&#8217;s the bestest of the bestest, or at least what i found so far ;), of spinning online:

  * ~ [joy of handspinning][2] & [i can spin][3] for the videos &#8211; so excellent
  * ~ bascially anything [purlwise][4] writes &#8211; very in depth, i love it
  * ~ [spinning fiber livejournal community][5], especially their wheel reviews
  * ~ [rosemary brock&#8217;s textilelinks][6]

i want to make [felted soap][7] badly. i&#8217;ve had a soapmaking kit for years now &#8211; wonder if it&#8217;s still good? &#8211; and this seems like a perfect segue. heide [made some][8], and don&#8217;t they look pretty?

there&#8217;s so many good spinning books out there, and one that seems interesting, though i&#8217;m less interested in knitting really crazy yarn than spinning it, is [pluckyfluff][9]. they even have a [camp][10] going on later this year. as much as i like the crazy stuff, i really want to be able to make yarn that looks picture-perfect &#8211; shoot, i want it all, you know what i mean?

have you heard about the [august eat local challenge][11]? liz writes about it very very persuasively. here in l.a. we&#8217;re lucky to have a ton of really great farmer&#8217;s markets that i used to go to on a somewhat regular basis. many a time i&#8217;ve toyed with the idea of getting local organic produce [delivered][12] [to my home][13] [on a weekly basis][14], but i always backed off. 

last but not least, how&#8217;s my no-refined-sugar week going? good, though i&#8217;ve had one very guilty transgression: tofutti&#8217;s delicious cuties ice cream sandwiches. they&#8217;re so good and i was just craving like mad and it was midnight, in my own self-defense. i may have had other transgressions, too &#8211; i haven&#8217;t been as vigilant as i should &#8211; but in general i&#8217;m being good and reading labels and cursing high fructose corn syrup&#8217;s name. typical me though, instead of researching what i can or can&#8217;t eat and shopping for healthy food and all that, i just end up eating less than i usually do. so lazy! i have had a large amount of delicious ratatouille with rice, and some great tofu & broccoli sandwiches, though, so it&#8217;s not been too bad.

i have some knitting disappointments but i don&#8217;t feel like brooding so i&#8217;ll deal with them later and not bother you all, for now at least. have a great weekend everybody <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> 

p.s. harry potter day! i&#8217;m holding off for a few weeks till i can get it super cheap &#8211; it&#8217;s all good, the anticipation will just be *that* much stronger.
