  * future book list up
  * <del>calendar working!</del>
  * <del>movies page within textpattern</del>
  * family page totally revamped and within textpattern
  * index page still possible with picture of mamacat?
  * <del>update colophon on about</del>
  * import new pictures to gallery
  * <del>get comments to pop-up</del>

i need to break out the old italian books very soon and do a little studying ~ needless to say i doubt i&#8217;ll do any such thing until actually on the plane, perhaps even descending into fiumicino airport. 

last night i had a delicious nachos meal a la hull family ~ delish indeed! chips, refried beans (pinto and black = fancy), extra sharp cheddar, lettuce (in a bag, easy easy), ripe tomatoes, spanish rice (from a box, easy easy), sour cream, salsa.. all in little bowls, then combine on plate one at a time, or as a mountain, or whatever floats your boat. i love finger food! (r.i.p. julia child)

how beautiful is this magazine: [phildar tendances][1]?! also, i ordered vogue knitting: ultimate reference book after loving the copy from the library. since i can&#8217;t knit, i&#8217;m stocking up on eye candy, um, i mean reference and pattern books..

**update:** got the calendar on the left there working, yay! (though it&#8217;s a little shakey-looking. gotta work on that later.)
