<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="87" /></span>just starting my day and it&#8217;s almost 4 pm&#8230; sigh. i stayed up last night till almost 5 am knitting, watching movies, and chatting on a forum supposedly devoted to politics but in general was more about socializing&#8230;it was a lot of fun but waking up at almost 1 pm today, i wondered where my saturday had gone. and then promptly stayed in bed for two more hours knitting and watching for the umpteenth time [ladyhawke][1] (great cheesy film, with a soundtrack by alan parsons, of [i can read your mind][2] fame).

yesterday after work i scored big time on some [rowan cotton tape yarn][3] that i&#8217;ve been envying for months but could no way afford at $11 a ball. happily, yesterday i looked in the sale trunk and there it was $10 for two balls in a pretty lilac and a deeper purple. i bought rowan&#8217;s [*it&#8217;s a tape thing*][4] months ago, when i was first starting to knit, and have felt slightly silly since i hadn&#8217;t yet made a thing from it. well, yesterday i got enough to make two sweaters, the tammy sweater and the infamous [carla][5]. (it&#8217;s pretty weird how the sweater patterns have female names. i don&#8217;t get it &#8211; naming boats after females makes a little more sense to me since sailors were traditionally male, but this knitting-naming thing? hm.) 

<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="88" /></span>anyhow, the stripey tammy sweater is coming along beautifully &#8211; i really like the colors, which look more like the second photo. i&#8217;m a little worried about the gauge. i didn&#8217;t swatch &#8211; just plump forgot in my excitement at knitting with rowan yarn as well as the pretty slipping on the cuffs/edges. it seems i&#8217;m getting the right amount of stitches widthwise but lengthwise my stitches are a little tight. i&#8217;ve had length problems [before][6] and i really really want to avoid that fiasco again. but, i&#8217;ve read online that the cotton tape does stretch &#8211; even though it&#8217;s cotton, which doesn&#8217;t usually. i guess because it&#8217;s tubular? anyhow, i will be watching very carefully.

now, on to the rest of my saturday. (feeling lonely, missing a boy.)

update: have switched to whopping size 13 and the gauge comes out perfect, lengthwise and widthwise. of course, that&#8217;s after i completed the front and a sleeve. ah well, ribbit ribbit.
