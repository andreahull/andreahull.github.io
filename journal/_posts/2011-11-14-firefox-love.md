title: firefox love

i’ve gone back and forth between google’s chrome and firefox for years now. (haven’t had internet explorer installed on my computer since the old gateway laptop died in 2000. before firefox, i used netscape navigator. ha, what a name.)

chrome is fast, especially compared to firefox’s memory-hogging ways, so i’m regulary tempted to stick with chrome. however, i already have so much of my online life connected to google (search engine, rss/blog reader, email, and bookmarks. theoretically google plus as well, but i’m barely using it so far.), that i really want something different than just another google product.

happily, it’s much easier to stick with firefox now, due to their tab groups feature. i use it constantly, re-arranging groups, labeling them, bookmarking and combining them. it’s such a great feature, give it a try.
