<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="1093" /></span>first, thank you for all the sweet birthday wishes via email, snail mail, comments and even a text message (which was the second one i&#8217;ve ever gotten. i felt so hip and with it. <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> ~ i&#8217;ve been living it up the last few days with lots of little happy-birthday-to-me gifts (shoes! skirts! books! food food food! fat quarters! a trip every day to the library! .. yeah, well for me, that&#8217;s living it up. i&#8217;ve also been spending some good aunt time with all the babies *and* as both my parents are away right now and will be for the next couple of weeks, i&#8217;m also animal-lady, taking care of three cats, eight fish (salt- and fresh-water), two dogs, and two horses. it&#8217;s been busy.

anyhow, for now, i just had to share this sweet video of my nephew gavin, who is a little over three months old. my sister took it today and as soon as she did, she said, like the proud mama she is, that i should post it for *everyone* to see. that gavin is such a great little baby. and who&#8217;s viva? i&#8217;ve probably mentioned it before, but yeah, that&#8217;s me, my nickname to the kids in the family. i *love* hearing my nieces and nephew yell out &#8220;vivaaa!&#8221; when they see me. at their ages (six and under), my enthusiasm with physical comedy (sitting on them &#8220;by accident&#8221;, &#8220;falling asleep&#8221; snoring while talking to them, dancing impromptu jigs, and so on) gets them all giggly and even more bright-eyed. mmmm. love that.

  
[if you have trouble seeing the video above, try [here][1] and, for those wanting more, [here&#8217;s][2] the longer version at fifty-two seconds (around 5 mb) ~ it may take a minute or so to load but be patient, it&#8217;s totally worth it. gavin is adorably vocal and i make all kinds of funny faces. ]

hm, after nine+ hours spent with four kids two and under and two kids in their thirties (my sis and her hub), i&#8217;m pooped. happy friday ~ ~
