so, i love the [paris loop poncho][1]. but it just wasn&#8217;t working for me. as you can see, the yarn itself is lovely lovely eye candy (and so soft to the touch! i feel like a baby&#8217;s bare butt is in my hands as i knit..) but, in the end, with only inches to go, i frogged the whole thing. that&#8217;s what i get for not only using a different yarn than the pattern called for, but also not doing a single gauge (much less the three gauges the pattern specified) **and** using entirely different needles (13, 11 and 9 all in 24&#8221;) and lengths. ah, the hubris of the &#8220;advanced beginner.&#8221;

after digging around online, i found enviable examples of the paris loop ([here][2], [here][3], [here][4] and [here][5]). now combine those pretty examples with [paper hat&#8217;s][6] wise point: &#8220;There&#8217;s often all sorts of dire consequences for making a mistake. In knitting, you get a DO-OVER. A DO-OVER&#8212;for free! Who doesn&#8217;t love that? You can rip it out, wet it down, start over. You can try the same thing again or try something different. &#8221; so, with all this in mind, of course, i heaved a mighty sigh and tried to frog with relish (not that hard, actually. <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" class="wp-smiley" /> ) 

i have not given up on paris loop, i&#8217;m just determined to cast-on with no more than 90 stitches (the poof yarn is much thicker and fluffier than cicco, the original yarn) and might even do some decreasing towards the top. also, i will not knit the stripes so big,   
maybe cut them in half. one of the things i like best about this pattern is that the poncho ends right around the waist (and even a bit above, depending on torsos, etc) but with this fluffy snowball yarn, i was in danger of ending up with a knee-length poncho.

(by the way, that second picture shows me wearing my mid-frogging poncho a la beauty contestant. yes, it was **that** big. see why i had to frog?!)

**but** (and this is an important redeeming but) as you can see, i did manage to be pretty knit-productive this past week, with the lovely endless holiday and weekend. before i left for italy, i bought this pretty yarn ( i have this thing for dark reds and purples) with the idea of knitting the stitch n bitch kittyville hat. and that&#8217;s what you see here, as modeled by my real-life kitty, the ever sweet and patient trouble.

i&#8217;m not that crazy about how the hat looks on me (hence no photo) but it was fun to knit. plus, i finally got to try out those addi turbo needles (verdict: fast perfect stitches, but the joining of metal to nylon bothered my hands, and i like the way bamboo feels better) and, most exciting of all, i made pompoms! yippee! very fun and oh so satisfying to cut open. while making them, i remembered being a little kid and watching my mom, who is a craftster extraordinaire (she used to make all her own clothing when she was a teenager, and always made our halloween costumes when i was little, as well as my first communion dress, my prom dress, and more, gracias mami!) work her magic as she made these pompoms. now, i too am a magical craftster. 

p.s. check out this [cecile telle][7] page ~ though a tad too modern and geometric (ikea-ish), overall i really like the style of these felted stuff.
