first off, thank you for all the sweet comments on my lovely nieces. these two are going to be a handful, i can tell already!

poll: organgina organina! it&#8217;s been done for over a month, but i&#8217;ve been relucatant to post photos, or even wear it for more than a minute, because it&#8217;s just.. well, it&#8217;s beautiful! but the fit is.. ok. yup, just *ok*. really, too loose, too baggy, and i see all these lovely ones out there that are form-fitting and gorgeous. so, my first poll, help me out here!

and now, meme time, brought to you by [winnie][2] <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> ..

10 years ago: i was breaking up with my first boyfriend and missing my second one like crazy. yup, i moved fast in those days. i was in italy, hanging out with my sisters, getting ready to spend a year abroad with my older sis. i had long long hair and was really into big clunky shoes. 

5 years ago: graduated from college and was driving across the country from maryland to l.a. all alone &#8211; top down, music blasting, hair flying, and a speeding ticket in almost every other state. every night, i&#8217;d stop at a motel and fall asleep exhausted, the sound of wind at high speeds still in my ears.

1 year ago: [knitting][3]! i was trying to grow my hair out, after cutting it uber-short while angry (scissors + hair = not a good idea when in a bad mood), and feeling stir crazy, stuck in los angeles.

yesterday: moody all morning, better by night. stuffed myself sick before going to sleep, realizing i like peanut brittle more than i thought.

today: happy, chatty, following one topic after another on the internet, i.e. browsing like there&#8217;s no tomorrow &#8211; so fun.

tomorrow: a long day at work, yeehaw.

5 snacks I enjoy: cheese, sour gummies, bruschetta, pizza, ice cream sandwiches

5 bands/singers I like: off the top of my head.. neil young, abba, pet shop boys, stereolab, and black sabbath. ok, not entirely off the top of my head &#8211; i&#8217;m all over the place, but really any real rock & roll will do, and lots of pop too.

5 bad habits that I have: biting nails, holding face in weird grimaces, not the cleanest of persons, exagerator extraordinaire, too chatty sometimes, especially &#8220;random chatty&#8221;, you know what i mean?

5 things I like doing: sleeping, reading, cooking, making, laughing

5 things I would never wear: really pointy shoes (i&#8217;m definitely a rounded toe kind of person), tapered pants, leather (i&#8217;m trying to get rid of what leather stuff i have, all i have left are some shoes..), fur

5 TV shows I like: any nanny shows, gilmore girls, pbs&#8217; re-enactments of olden times (like..), extreme makeover home edition (i get all teary sometimes, especially because paulie is so dang sweet.), and (sometimes) quiz shows like jeopardy, because i like to feel smart or else be really embarassed at how little i know (mood varies)

5 famous people I&#8217;d like to meet: nobody. i&#8217;d be too shy. oh! ralph nader &#8211; he always seems so decent but dresses so shabby and has those sad hooded eyes, i always wonder if he has someone who&#8217;s taking care of him, who makes sure he&#8217;s ok. kinda weird, but there it is.

5 biggest joys of the moment: my cats (seriously. when everything else is down, i just look around me, and they&#8217;re all sitting next to me and purring and i just want to *squeeze* them, you know?), my family, the potential of the future, the incredible luck i&#8217;ve had in meeting some incredible people, knowing that things can change in an instant. 

5 favorite toys: my long-lost spinning wheel (sniff), my laptop, my library card (such a dork, but really, i can get all this stuff &#8211; satisfy my shopping impulses &#8211; for free! movies, books, music, you name it.), and that&#8217;s it. only 3. such an adult, huh? tsk tsk.

hope your weekend was delicious! (ha, shows where my mind is &#8211; or rather how full my stomach is, yum.)
