hi, i&#8217;m andrea hull. a moody, vegetarian, polyglot, pisces, 29 year old, middle child, introvert, 5&#8217;3&#8221; fiber-crazy bibliophile.

i just graduated from ucla&#8217;s [department of information studies][1] with my very own <acronym title="master of library and information studies">mlis</acronym> and am currently the deputy administrator at the newly-born [california rare book school][2]. after aug. 31st, i will officially be unemployed and i have no plans to get a job for a bit, if i can help it. i&#8217;ve been in l.a. for six years this summer and plan to leave it sometime between oct 1st and nov 1st this year, a fact which scares/saddens/excites/overwhelms me on a pretty regular basis.

you&#8217;ll most often find me home sweet home! that&#8217;s a teeny apartment in koreatown with a loud street just outside my windows, bad pipes, and faulty electricity, but i love it. home is also sometimes maryland, just a few miles from the potomac river.

i love to read, eat carbs and grease, shower, play with my cats, dress up, go to sleep, play with little kids, make stuff, laugh, and make others laugh. i&#8217;m not very good at knowing when to leave or stop, expressing myself beyond simplicities and pat/practiced resposes, reading non-fiction, keeping to to-do lists, keeping in touch, or keeping my temper. i&#8217;m a pretty agressive driver, i&#8217;m afraid ~ all my repressed anger just bubbles up and i start cussing and feeling really competitive, so it&#8217;s a good thing i sold my car in july. it&#8217;s all about the bus now, in sickness and in health, etc etc.

this past year has been a ginormous kick in the pants and i&#8217;m still trying to just survive it as gracefully as i can, with the least amount of lasting damage to myself and others as possible. wish me luck, and good luck to you as well.

a great philosophy: &#8220;first, do no harm.&#8221; 

mini-colophon(ish):

  * &#187; [a mac 15&#8221; powerbook][3]
  * &#187; [bbedit][4]
  * &#187; [kodak easyshare cx6330][5]
  * &#187; [textpattern][6]*
  * &#187; [zenphoto][7]
  * &#187; [w3schools][8] for web help, they&#8217;re excellent

[* now i use the excellent [textpattern][9], but before i tried &#8216;rolling my own&#8217;, and did pretty nicely if i may say so myself, using some basic php to access mysql databases, [atomz][10], for free searching, and for commenting, first i tried [symbio][11] (commenting cgi script &#8211; it&#8217;s great and open source!) but it was a little overkill for me, so i set up [dotcomments][12], which worked fine and needs no sql databases or weird cgi-stuff, i.e. it&#8217;s very easy (and fully customizable)]
