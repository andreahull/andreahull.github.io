these fabrics make me want to sew clothing for my baby girl. the matryoshka pattern merits a closer look, btw. <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" />

so, yeah, going back for more fabric soon. unfortunately for you, you can’t feel how the fabric feels – i wish i knew what to call it, but it’s texture and sturdiness is almost like oilcloth but no, it’s clearly cotton, just a very sturdy and soft cotton. perfect for toddler clothing.

and with the way our baby is trying to stand and loves taking steps while holding our hands, we’ll be there sooner than later, i’m thinking.
