<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="820" /></span>i didn&#8217;t mean to hibernate as long as i did, and in reality it was a hard-working hibernation, not the sweet sleeping that the groundhog is doing in the previous post, but now i think i&#8217;m ready to pop up and say hello again. hi!

just a few catch-up things:

my [project spectrum][1] card arrived a while back and is fabulous &#8211; as you can see. thanks [jennifer][2]! here&#8217;s hoping mine has arrived by now in good condition &#8211; i&#8217;m worried it may have gotten lost in the mail..

<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="821" /></span>my week in maryland was great but, as my brother just agreed, the length of it &#8220;pretty much sucked&#8221; <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" /> &#8211; six days is never enough, and in this case, three of those days were filled with conference-attending. this meant there was a whole bunch of stuff i didn&#8217;t get to do &#8211; including just chilling out, cooking, meeting up with some great people, driving around & enjoy maryland, etc &#8211; so the night before i left i was downright pissed off at myself and cranky as all. ah well. 

the *conference*, however, rocked. a day or so before i left, i started a [library blog][3], which i intend to keep up, and officially blogged the conference, which is a great great way to meet and socialize with other conference attendees/bloggers. i&#8217;m so glad i went and i&#8217;m really looking forward to [internet librarian][4] this fall in monterey &#8211; barring any weirdness, i totally intend to go. <span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="822" /></span>very fun.

i&#8217;ve been spinning &#8211; and how! &#8211; and i also stained my wheel a natural color, i.e. no real stain at all. however, even though i agree logically that darker stains might obscure a little the detail of the wheel, as [kitty kitty][5] put it, the darker stains *do* make the wheel look more &#8220;rumpilstiltskin&#8221;-y. so! dark i go. let&#8217;s hope i don&#8217;t regret it <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> 

knitting has also been happening. first, just for fun, to see what it looks like, a bit of my first handspun on the minstral, and then, yes, that&#8217;s a finished and blocking fair isle bag. yay! and just in time &#8211; [mj][6]&#8217;s [norwegian knitalong][7] ends this week and i&#8217;m determined to have it seamed, lined, and finished by thursday. i&#8217;m pretty happy with my fair isle techniquie, though i&#8217;ve steam blocked it like there&#8217;s no tomorrow, which helped a lot with odd tensions and such.<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="823" /></span>

and that&#8217;s it. in ten weeks i graduate with a [masters in library and information studies][8]. in six or seven months, i&#8217;m moving somewhere. lots of changes coming &#8211; and i have a very bad habit of falling apart and freaking out when change approaches, particularly graduations. as much as possible, i just want to conclude this bit here with as much grace as possible. for now, fiber, books, music, and my cats are keeping me sane. 

hope your weekend was beautiful ~
