i&#8217;ve been writing here for so long and then i go through six weeks with barely a post..! quite an unexpected summer break &#8211; hmph, i&#8217;m not liking that, so: 

happiness is a honey of a nephew who loves my scratchy knitting. it&#8217;s such a difference texture from all the cuddly toys and hard plastic that he feels all the time..! too many cute pictures to choose just one &#8211; this baby boy is only seven months old, but such a personality already. and though he still loves a good game of peek-a-boo, he&#8217;s growing up [so fast][1], snif.

as for the knitting, it&#8217;s a soon-to-be bulky-knit jacket (a.k.a. impromptu knitting while i contemplate knitting [rogue][2]&#8216;s hood). i&#8217;m finishing up the last few inches of the left front piece, then i pick up stitches for the collar, hope the sleeves fit the body, and seam away. slightly boring color, but kinda nice for the fall, don&#8217;t you think? plus i&#8217;m finally using up some beginner yarn that&#8217;s been stewing in the stash for over three years, yay.

besides all the above, i&#8217;ve been babysitting for two+ days four kids under the age of three &#8211; love them, but it&#8217;s still hard work; then today, seven hours of My First Solo Reference Work at two different [library branches][3], hooray!; and lastly a paper studio entirely under my control(mwah hah hah)/responsibility(gasp) for the next two weeks, which equals a lot of work there too. so, all in all, a tired andrea, but [a satisfied one][4]. plus i splurged and bought a new dress and a fall jacket. pretty clothes do wonders for the spirits. hm. 

hope you have a wonderful sunday ~ ~
