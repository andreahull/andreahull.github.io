hi there ~ hope everyone&#8217;s holidays were great. as always, i&#8217;m just getting used to writing and thinking 2004, and now 2005 is just four days away! 

<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="50" /></span>christmas was great, and crazy busy in a very happy way. this year i made three of my gifts. my immediate family, including spouses and kids, has grown from 7 to 12 in just three years, and it&#8217;s sure to keep growing for a while still. (after all, my little sisters and me haven&#8217;t even started yet with the whole kids thing!) so, this year i made a decision that i will make three or four gifts a year, and the rest will be storebought. this way, i reasoned, i wouldn&#8217;t be killing myself trying to get gifts for everyone done, especially since this invariably means staying up all night christmas eve and being horribly tired all christmas day. belatedly, a friend pointed out that means i have now committed to making gifts every year &#8211; eek! 

this year i made three gifts, two of which you see here. the first is claudi&#8217;s felted bag. she&#8217;s a gal who likes bright colors, especially in the winter time, so i knew this bubblegum pink would thrill her. and she&#8217;s a girl who likes her bling, so the brooch works perfectly. i made the bag out of lamb&#8217;s wool worsted, just barely over a skein&#8217;s worth, using [magknits&#8217; sophie pattern][1], changing it slightly because claudi requested two handles versus the one twisted one the pattern called for. 

<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="49" /></span>the second handmade gift is shown in this great photo of my sweet niece rileigh right after she had opened her present and just pulled the [kittyville][2] hat on (thanks for taking the photo, luci!) i made the hat a while back and quickly decided it would fit rileigh to a t, and indeed she seems to like it a lot. yay!

i also made my older sister daniella a [booga bag][3], using the same kureyon yarn that&#8217;s shown in the pattern photo. she loved it and was using it the next day, which was thrilling. 

for both of the felted bags, i used my mom&#8217;s washing machine which had not very hot water. and since i couldn&#8217;t figure out when it was going into spin cycle, i ended up putting both bags through two cycles each. i think both of these things ended up shrinking both bags a lot and on top of that made them have much more of a &#8216;halo&#8217; than i had with my first felted bag. i&#8217;ve read online that one could easliy just cut the halo away using scissors, but my sisters said they liked the halos. 

other than that, i was supposed to be back in l.a. already today! the thing is, i got a call this morning saying my flight was canceled and that they were sorry but i wouldn&#8217;t be able to find a flight leaving d.c. until *thursday*. i was mighty pissed off &#8211; called half a dozen different places and finally got the last seat on a flight leaving tomorrow at 7 am, arriving in l.a. at noon. i&#8217;m so ready to go home! 

ok, off to sleep for a half hour till i gotta get up to go to the airport (yay) &#8211; g&#8217;night and thanks for reading this thrilling post <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" />
