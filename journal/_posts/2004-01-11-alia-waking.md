## by Laura Wil Mccaffrey 

in case it wasn&#8217;t obvious already, children&#8217;s literature makes up most of my favorite writing &#8211; there&#8217;s less cynicism, needless violence and unhappy sex, and tons of imagination, humor, and questions. 

this book was good; somewhat predictable but good. 

and best of all, it left me with the atmosphere of this other world the author had created, where trees whisper and little girls listen. ..really nice, i hope there&#8217;s more of these types coming.
