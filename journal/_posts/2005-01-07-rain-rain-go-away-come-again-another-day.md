hello and happy friday ~

just heard on the radio that we&#8217;re expected to get something around 10 inches of rain during the next four days &#8211; which normally would be a lot for southern california as it is, but with the already twelve inches and more of rain we&#8217;ve received the past two weeks, this just means scarier and crazier driving conditions than ever. 

i&#8217;m very happy to report not only am i still emailing my high school friend (hi amy!) that just got married but i also got a very cool email from my other closest friend in high school (hi erica!). they both sound so grown up and accomplished but what i like most is reading/seeing how much they are still the girls i used to know. very fun and i&#8217;m very glad to be in touch again. i remember in high school, and really all through school, elementary through college, i always was really bad at keeping in touch, at staying friends once i became friends, unless circumstances (i.e. classes, boys, dorm assignments, etc) made it easy. that&#8217;s a very bad habit to fall into and leads one down a lonely path for sure. 

there&#8217;s about half a dozen people that i&#8217;ve met in various school circumstances that i really just clicked with and that i basically want to know forever. i don&#8217;t have to hang out or even be in touch with them all the time &#8211; but at least once in a while i want to hear from them, tell them what i&#8217;m up to, and just be in each other&#8217;s lives, you know? well, this recent communications makes me think i have two less people to hunt down, wonder about, and in general feel like i missed the boat on. yay. 

in other news: first day of classes was this morning. my reference class, a requirement i skipped last year since i knew i was in for the three year haul. but now, here it and surprise surprise, i think i&#8217;m going to like it. definitely a class to take the knitting projects to, but all in a all, an interesting and happily not too demanding class, it seems. 

lastly, some links: my [i-can&#8217;t-believe-i-have-a-bed ][1]story and my [new gallery/fotos][2] section. please tell me if you have any problems seeing the fotos or if something looks whack (though the typical disclaimer &#8220;it&#8217;s a work in progress&#8221; applies as always, sigh). thanks and have a beautiful weekend unlike us here in 24/7 rain land!
