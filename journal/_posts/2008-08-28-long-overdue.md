~ bolivia&#8217;s president evo morales is under a lot of pressure from those who previously held all the power in bolivia and are pretty unhappy that he&#8217;s leading a movement of the indigenous majority to take control of bolivia&#8217;s future. they keep trying to kick him out or undermine him or etc etc. it&#8217;s ridiculous. he&#8217;s a great president and one that bolivia&#8217;s needed so badly. i was very proud when he was elected president three years ago and i still am today. go evo! [for more info on him, start with these maybe: [1][1], [2][2], [3][3], [4][4], [5][5], [6][6]]

~ after six years, this is still my favorite [color helper][7] for website work

~ a few weeks ago, i watched a lot of tv on [hulu][8].. it&#8217;s free, though there&#8217;s 15 second ads now and then, but there&#8217;s not only tv shows like arrested development (all three seasons!), there&#8217;s movies like the fifth element and fever pitch. great for knitting <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> 

~ this documentary, [a classroom divided][9] is pretty amazing, about race in the u.s. and an experiment a teacher started with her students in 1968. check it out.

~ i bought a new bike! and have been biking at least three times a week for the past few weeks, yay. my favorite place to bike? [the c & o canal][10].. now i just need to print out the [handy map][11] they provide and tape it to my bike. hooray for cruisers and beautiful late summer weather. 

~ [papercdcase.com][12] will make a nice little paper holder for your cds, perfect for sending off those mix cds to friends, or for yourself. free.

~ [simon&#8217;s cat][13] shows what every cat person knows all too well .. you dog people have it eaaaasy. <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" />

~ the other day, i cleaned up my itunes library &#8211; so many of the songs had little exclamation marks before them, indicating dead files, it was getting frustrating. i knew i had almost all of the songs on my backup, so using [this handly little applescript][14], the problem is now fixed, with only a dozen songs still missing. (i&#8217;ll find them!) 

~ .. and for those that get a little frustrated generally with itunes, check out [the above website][15] for more scripts. i especially like: List <span class="caps">MIA</span>s, Make Bookmarkable, Export Smart List Criteria. one warning though, it&#8217;s only for macs. sorry pc users!

~ as i bike along, i start thinking big thoughts, like oh maybe i&#8217;ll start that [100 pushups program][16]. imagine! 100 consecutive pushups. too cool.

~ i love the newest firefox. have you [updated][17]? i especially love that i can type in the url box just the title of something i looked at before, or the parts of the url that i remember &#8211; not necessarily in order &#8211; and firefox will pull up the page using my browser history. it&#8217;s awesome. and some of the add-ons and extensions are super great, especially [taboo][18], which makes bookmarking easy-peasy and super visual, and   
[download helper][19], which i use save copies of my favorite youtube videos.

~ these three knits have caught my eye: [fresco vest][20] from [classic elite yarn][21], [this cardgigan][22] makes me think of my (award-winning, ha! <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> handspun jacob yarn, and last but not least, [little birds][23] is a sweet knit that i&#8217;m just itching to knit. but i&#8217;m just about done with shawl #2 and i still have shawl #3 to do plus eight (!) wips waiting for me. there&#8217;s just too much to knit! .. oh and the colors of [these knits][24] are great, aren&#8217;t they?

~ did you hear about [the librarian who got kicked out of a mccain rally in denver][25] because she was holding a sign that said &#8216;mccain = bush&#8217;. !

~ there&#8217;s just a few albums i consider practically perfect, and stereolab&#8217;s dots and loops is one of them. [this song][26], from that album, is paired with a [stan brakhage][27] film, and it&#8217;s just beautiful and hypnotic. love those backup singers.

~ [nutrition data][28] is a handy website that has exhaustive information on food. like say you want to find what food out there has the highest amound of vitamin b12 in it that&#8217;s vegetarian-friendly? [look here][29] &#8211; and yeah, you can set up an account and set preferences so that, for example, braised moose liver doesn&#8217;t even show up for a veggie diet. ha. anyhow, it&#8217;s a useful site.

~ look at these [amazing cloud pictures][30] &#8211; &#8211; lately i&#8217;ve been watching clouds overhead roll by and it just pulls you in. but if the clouds had looked anything like *these*, it would have not only pulled me in but knocked me over. [via [twoswallows][31]]

thanks again for the all the comments and emails ~ it&#8217;s been a really difficult year and summer especially. i can&#8217;t imagine this is something anyone ever really gets over, but good friends help to make one feel less freaked out. today is my dad&#8217;s birthday ~ he would have been sixty-three. it&#8217;s a special day for all of us here in the hull family, so i&#8217;m hoping that all you nice people have a little of that special-ness rub off onto your own day. as for me, i&#8217;m finally working regularly again, and being in a library doing the job i love is one my dad would be happy to see on his birthday. take care ~ ~
