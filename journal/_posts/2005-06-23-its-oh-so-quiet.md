hi ~ it&#8217;s been a while, how are ya? <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> me, busy as always, but sans computer (sob), i&#8217;ve been feeling pretty internet-deprived. as i sit waiting to talk to an apple rep (they have good muzak, though a tad too moody for impatient folks like me), i thought i&#8217;d type up a bit saying what&#8217;s up..

[i know you&#8217;re probably sick of my lists, but for my tidy mind, they&#8217;re fun, so nyahhh]

  * ~ my sisters arrived last night and they&#8217;re here for a week. they&#8217;re 23, twins, [runners][1], [loads of fun][2], and i love them to death.
  * ~ they packed me a lunch this morning, mozarella and tomato sandwich with balsamic vinegar and oil on wheat bread. yum. and amazing, as i haven&#8217;t brought a lunch to work in probably over a year.
  * ~ my apartment is sparklingly clean. it&#8217;ll last maybe a day more, but that&#8217;s enough, a good first impression was made.
  * ~ i&#8217;m making an adorable (if i do say so myself) striped baby top &#8211; it&#8217;s from [early arrivals #2][3], a sirdar pattern book using [sirdar&#8217;s snuggly 4-ply][4], an acrylic mix that is surprisingly soft and, more importantly for my poor sis, machine-washable.
  * ~ i finally put the car in the shop (the radiator was leaking so much that i had to refill it with water every few hours or so, bad andrea!) and rented a civic (the most stolen car in the country) from rent-a-wreck(!). i&#8217;ve named the car &#8216;lurch&#8217;.
  * ~ i&#8217;m feeling very experimental &#8211; i want to try all kinds of make-up (never was a big make-up person, mostly just mascara and i&#8217;m done) and nail polish and clothing, just be really girly. very easy with my sisters around, they&#8217;re so very highly groomed, i feel like a sloth next to them. we&#8217;re aveda freaks but i want to try [lush cosmetics][5], it&#8217;s supposed to be divine.
  * ~ i just found this: [the greater los angeles spinning guild][6] &#8211; how cool is that! their web page is impressively designed and has a great list of links. i really want to try spinning, and i have done *some* drop spindle spinning, but i know i need (local) inspiration to get me going. 
  * ~ last week, i knitted up some wristbands (from stitch n bitch) &#8211; first time doing intarsia and it was fun. 
  * ~ i gave my sisters my [cabled tank][7] and a [one skein wonder in white][8] &#8211; they loved both and i was so proud so proud. i adore making things for those i love, especially when they&#8217;re so obviously tickled pink. yay! 
  * ~ i ordered my first yarn color card &#8211; i think that now makes me a Responsible Knitter. right?

during the next week, my sisters want to: <strike>see &#8220;wicked&#8221; the musical</strike>(too expensive! ah well) , a tv show taping of &#8220;ellen&#8221;, a movie premiere (maybe &#8220;war of the worlds&#8221;), <strike>eat at calif. pizza kitchen</strike>, go shopping on melrose, <strike>the glendale galleria</strike>, <strike>and ikea in burbank</strike>, try out new food recipes at my place, <strike>pig out and watch movies</strike>, <strike>see where i work</strike>, go out dancing, <strike>eat at my favorite restaurants</strike>, and <strike>talk talk talk till we croak</strike>. all of which needs to be photo-journalized so we&#8217;ll remember it forever and ever amen. let&#8217;s see how much we can actually tackle. i *will* be knitting this week, trying to lure them over to the dark side. [insert evil chuckle and knuckle rubbing in anticipation]

and once again, the tease: pictures soon. [crossing my fingers] 

hope you all are good and enjoying your mid-week. happy (belated) solstice!
