## by Elizabeth M Pope 

a perfect fall reading book. this was one of those books that, although i&#8217;d had it out of the library for weeks now, i just put off reading but.. within ten pages, was certain i was in for a good time. (i love those types of books!)

pope&#8217;s writing reminded me of mary stewart&#8217;s writing, but not too much, which is good. usually i hate reading about the end of fairies and magic and all that, but this book persuaded me that in this situation at least, it was called for: these fairy folk were downright nasty.
