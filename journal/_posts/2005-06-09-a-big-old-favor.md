***update:*** *thank you so much! i got a dozen responses in less than 24 hours &#8211; i appreciate it so much. make sure those of you who responded get your addresses [to me][1] so i can send off a little thank you this weekend <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> i knew it before but now i know it even better: knitters rock.*

hello there ~ first off, the favor request, and then a little catch up..

as it&#8217;s my last week of the quarter, i have final papers due and it&#8217;s been crazy. for one of my classes (&#8220;Archival Access & Description&#8221;), we had the option of writing a 20 page &#8216;literature review&#8217; on archival theory (yikes) *or* conducting usability tests for some archive&#8217;s website and writing up recommendations on how to make it more accessible. of course i jumped at the usability test &#8211; i&#8217;m hopefully taking an [information architecture][2] class this summer (it looks so very excellent, i love [that stuff][3]) so this would be a perfect segue. 

now here is where *you* come in. i only need about 5 to 10 people to participate in the test, and it&#8217;s online, and should take only five to ten minutes max. here&#8217;s the bait: the first ten people who do the test, leave me a comment here telling me you did it and i&#8217;ll send you some yarn. yes, i&#8217;m bribing you with yarn &#8211; will it work? (by the way, if you&#8217;re not a knitter, you should start right now! no, i&#8217;m kidding, really, just tell me and i&#8217;ll send something just as good, promise.) i need to get the paper in by this tuesday so i really need the usability tests to be completed by sunday, that&#8217;s four days. are you up for it, folks? i&#8217;ll be so grateful, thanks so much. 

here&#8217;s the link: [usability test][4]. (p.s. you don&#8217;t have to use your real name, and of course, any info submitted is totally confidential and i&#8217;ll not share it with a soul, except for my teacher. there&#8217;s nothing super-secret there, but just so ya know.)

now some ketchup.. (groan). after my recent knitting mania, i haven&#8217;t done much in the past four days or so, just [a lot of reading][5] and sleeping and constant work-to-school-to-work commuting and hecticness. it&#8217;s slowing down but this is the final stretch, can&#8217;t wait till it&#8217;s over. orangina pics have been postponed till next week, which is frustrating but realistic. also, my beloved powerbook was sent off yesterday and already arrived today at apple headquarters &#8211; so yup, i&#8217;m offline at home. it sucks just like you would imagine and really, it feels surreal. i was reading a great book last night and i kept getting the urge to see what [amanda][6] was up to, had [winnie][7] posted any more fabulous knits, see [lolly][8]&#8217;s pretty wedding pics again, has bloglines updated (up to 111 feeds! must. stop.), oh i must respond to [meowgirl][9]&#8217;s incredibly sweet email, etc etc.. but then i&#8217;d remember &#8216;oh. no internet.&#8217; and i&#8217;d feel all woozy and kinda silly. 

a friend shamed me for not adding this when i was bemoaning my mac problems last week: i&#8217;ve been using my powerbook for over two years and it has been nothing but sweet happiness for almost the entire two years. if not 100% sweet happiness, then 98%. really. and if applecare is as good as i think it is, i&#8217;ll go back to years of sweet happiness &#8211; and, more importantly, my days of fiddling with pcs is over (except at work, ah well) because macs *rule* .
