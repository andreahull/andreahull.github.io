my [tammy sweater][1] is done &#8211; and yet [again][2] (drum roll please) it seems like i made it too small. so frustrating. it&#8217;s blocking right now or else i&#8217;d disastrously model it. i&#8217;m hoping against hope that the washing and blocking will help either shrink it so it&#8217;ll just be a tight sweater or loosen it up so it&#8217;ll be like the sweater in the pattern book. this time i choose the right size, i got the correct gauge (after some false starts), but silly me, when the pattern said &#8220;to fit bust size &#8221; they meant to fit *tightly* not *loosely* like on the model in the book. argh. argh- i know what stripes look like on me, and believe me, tight stripes is not a good look! 

now, if i&#8217;d been experienced, i probably would&#8217;ve known that rowan patterns often have to be adjusted for fit, or else i would&#8217;ve figured out ahead of time that so-many stitches results in so-many inches and that would&#8217;ve helped me realize i need to move up a pattern size or two. but argh, i&#8217;m just a newbie. that&#8217;s so frustrating. 

.. nonetheless, i learned a bunch of new skills: binding off in rib pattern, slipping stitches for decorative cuff part, knitting in more than one color (a simple skilly but boy was i happy with it!), raglan seaming and construction, and more than anything, a better understanding of the mattress stitch. typing that out makes me feel better, definitely. phew. 

if there&#8217;s any change in how it fits me, i will definitely post a pic or two tomorrow of it on me, otherwise you&#8217;ll see a pic of it nicely draped on my bed <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> 

oh, and, ahem, i&#8217;m sick today, cough cough, no work.
