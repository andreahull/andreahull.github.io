hello!

i got in to ucla! yeah! it took forever and a day for them to accept me and even at the last moment i couldn&#8217;t quite tell from the email i received if i was for sure for sure accepted but with some quick help from vacya and his mom in interpreting the email, i was sure&#8212; i&#8217;m really excited&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.. and feeling entirely overwhelmed by my life, especially lately. (i feel like i&#8217;m always saying that. ay..) i gotta take statistics this summer at santa monica college yuck and hopefully my bryn mawr computer class will count as the computer science requirement but ohmy so much to do. and i just moved in two weeks ago- gotta get a bed and a fridge still. but i&#8217;m happy! and smiley and full just full of plans. 

bye,  
andrea the librarian!
