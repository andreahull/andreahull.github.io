first off, thanks so much for all the great comments on lelah! you all rock and are so supportive, i really appreciate it. i&#8217;m super-proud of the entire lelah project and had a great time with the whole process of knitting it, blocking it, modeling it, etc &#8211; it&#8217;s exactly the type of knitting project i want to always be doing. <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" />

and literally that (and my sweet cats, don&#8217;t laugh) has been the only brightness for the last few days. today at least i have a valid public reason for my crappy mood: i have to go to *work* today, yes a *saturday*. sucks. other than that, i know i have so many reasons *not* to be cranky/sad/whatever &#8211; things are so great in lots of areas, but some just get me down so much. and besides that i just have this antsy wandering thing in me where i just pace around my apartment picking up one thing after another. what is it with me?! such a mood monster. 

yesterday i was supposed to offically become a permanent staff member, complete with benefits, paid sick days, and all that&#8212;wohoo! i&#8217;ve been temping for them for over two years so i&#8217;ve been feeling more and more like the word &#8216;chump&#8217; was written on my forehead &#8211; in other words, it&#8217;s about friggin&#8217; time.

anyhow, yesterday, one of the ladies who works there came up to me and said &#8216;oh, bad news, i don&#8217;t know what happened but&#8230; the application didn&#8217;t go through, you can&#8217;t start permenant today..&#8217; and just stood there shaking her head while i gasped like a fish out of water and felt my fury start to rise. a few other staff folk were around and they started making little &#8216;ohhhh&#8217; comments, and i just kept staring at her saying &#8216;what? what!?&#8217;, daydreaming standing up, yelling i quit and just stomping out of there forever. then, she looks at me, looks at everyone else gathered around, and yells out &#8216;april fools!&#8217; 

not funny. not funny at all. i knew i didn&#8217;t like that whole april fools thing. ah. glad to know i&#8217;m part of the &#8216;team&#8217; now, it feels *so* good. (can you tell i&#8217;m a tad bitter? ah well.)

p.s. one happy thing for those than can afford it: WEBS is having an [incredible incredible yarn sale][1]. check it out.
