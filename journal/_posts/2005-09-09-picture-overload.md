<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="666" /></span>hi. it&#8217;s friday, so i decided to post a ton of pictures, hoping to entertain you on this last day of the working week (yeehaw). 

first off, meet slim, [bubby][1]&#8217;s cousin. unlike cuddly roly-poly laid-back bubby, slim is a little older and, so, a little more worried. he&#8217;s also a bit scrawny and has a sprained left ankle &#8211; hence the swelling you see (ahem). he is destined for my sweet niece kiyra and hopefully she will make him a happier bear. (more info on slim&#8217;s [project page][2])

[black sheep knittery][3], a good lys &#8211; though usually too pricey for me, recently had an enormous sale, with a ton of really great yarn for $1-3 a ball. i went and shopped my heart out (what a weird phrase, now that i&#8217;ve typed it..), buying maybe $250 of great yarn for $50. the kind of sale you dream about (silly me, what dreams i have!)

the haul:<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="671" /></span> eight balls of lana grossa&#8217;s 100% merino royal tweed, eight balls of some GGH cotton tape, one ball of GGH java &#8211; i love that yarn &#8211; and lastly i snagged some old R2 paper skeins in a pretty green.

then, when i got home i decided to take a good hard look at my stash &#8211; and nope, this isn&#8217;t all of it, but probably half of it (gulp). i frogged a number of items &#8211; it felt so good, just riiiiip, you know? i even tossed out one, just put it right in the trash &#8211; the stitches were really reluctant to part with each other &#8211; and it felt good. 

i&#8217;m also finally accepting that i&#8217;m becoming one of those purple people &#8211; i love purple! <span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="667" /></span>really though, i think it&#8217;s red&#8217;s fault &#8211; i truly love red, so much that i&#8217;ll take it in any of its various forms, however distant, i.e. pink, burgundy, rose, lilac, purple, etc. 

until that day, when i took a good look at the yarn i had, i hadn&#8217;t been knitting much at all in weeks &#8211; partially because i was traveling, the weather was too hot, my mood was bad bad, but also partially for reasons i couldn&#8217;t figure out. i was worrying, maybe this knitting thing for me is slowly ending, that my enthusiasm is just going going gone? 

now, i&#8217;ve realized, i was just feeling overwhelmed with all the knitting *stuff* i had accumulated<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="672" /></span> &#8211; especially all the unfinished projects that i just wasn&#8217;t crazy about. i&#8217;ve slowed down my yarn-buying these last four months or so, and am now *only* buying on sale and *only* getting enough to actually make something, i.e. at least four balls, in general.

that same weekend, i went to my first [spinning guild meeting][4] &#8211; it was great. i was all nervous and shy, but the women (and a few men) &#8211; about twenty-people &#8211; were really welcoming and sweet. 

they brought in a professional storyteller and we all sat there either spinning, carding, fluffing, knitting, felting, etc. etc. while he &#8220;spun yarns&#8221;. <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> i got to try out three more wheels &#8211; a lendrum, a journey wheel, and a reeves. and one very nice women gave me this basket of, as she called it, &#8220;sacrificial fiber&#8221;, i.e. for any newbies who came to the meeting to practice spinning. <span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="670" /></span>

i&#8217;ve learned i don&#8217;t mind double drive wheels, that i *do* in fact prefer double treadles, and that while i&#8217;d be happy with any sort of wheel, i love the classic look of older castle wheels. that is, the lendrum is a great wheel with amazing ratios but the look, for now at least, a little too modern for me. 

i&#8217;m hopefully going to try out a majacraft rose some time this month, and i&#8217;d really like to see a kromski in action. one thing for sure, as much as i like &#8211; and miss! &#8211; the ashford traveller i rented, the way bobbins are taken off worries me more and more &#8211; it&#8217;s just plastic! &#8211; versus on other wheels, it seems to be done much more thoroughly, with wood and hinges and sturdier material. <span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="669" /></span>

then, here&#8217;s some yarn i discovered while sorting through my stash (!). when my mom came to visit me back in march, she brought me some yarn from bolivia! 100% alpaca in various weights and colors &#8211; here, i skeined up the buttery worsted-weight white alpaca. 

i&#8217;d love to make a [hot lava][5] with it &#8211; a la [winnie][6]&#8217;s gorgeous white one &#8211; but i&#8217;m such a wuss, alpaca makes me itch like crazy. but the cats go crrrazy over the alpaca smell and that&#8217;s always good for a laugh.

then,<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="674" /></span>like a month ago i happened to spy at a local very-expensive-and-very-snooty yarn store (coughwildfibercough) in their 50% off section some brand new ashford hand cards. i couldn&#8217;t believe the price but they said yes it was 50% off and then asked me what hand cards where used for &#8211; one sales lady said &#8220;oh, that&#8217;s for felting, right?&#8221; ha. 

(hey, if anyone else wants some, just [write][7] me.)

last but not least, christine&#8217;s [bevin tank top pattern][8] &#8211; i love me some lace! and this top came out so cute &#8211; except for the fact it&#8217;s *three* inches too short! once again, my powers of self-recognition fail me &#8211; this is like the third top i&#8217;ve made that is just way too short. <span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="673" /></span>so frustrating. it only took a few days to knit, and the yarn is really fun to knit with, so i&#8217;m hoping this frogging and re-knitting won&#8217;t be too sad. 

and there you have it, folks &#8211; a truly fiber recap of the past month. this is what&#8217;s helped me just deal with these last horrible angry sad weeks. i know i rambled a bit &#8211; hey, i&#8217;m lonely &#8211; but if you lasted this far, lemme just say you are sweet and patient. yes, you are.

p.s. didn&#8217;t realize it, but my [fotos section][9] was down for a while so i decided to just overhaul it for good &#8211; i&#8217;m still working on the styling, but it should at least *work* now.
