hello!

it&#8217;s raining! not just a drizzle but a real downpour. i love it.. i&#8217;ve been looking forward to this weekend for so long, not because of anything special just cause it&#8217;s the weekend. argh, i&#8217;m so tired of school and work and traffic. i support the mta strike and the supermarket strikes but the mta one is really making the traffic even more of a headache. this weekend there are two very cool things going on: at ucla, [the maquiladora murders conference][1], on the women of juarez; and on sunday, the [southern california handweavers&#8217; guild ][2] is having their annual [weaving & spinning festival][3]{.norm}! very cool. oh! also very cool, i&#8217;m the new technology officer for the [society of american archivists&#8217;][4]{.norm} student chapter at [ucla][5]{.norm}&#8212;basically that means i&#8217;m the new webmaster. yay! tonight has been a great halloween night with two sweet cats, one sweet boy, and a comfy clean warm apartment with great music and good food. this coming month is going to be really crazy but so far i&#8217;m on top of things except for sleep.
