one thing about displaying more than a post at a time : it&#8217;s really easy to just give in to the urge to post more than once a day. before, i would think to myself &#8216;hold on to that idea for one day more because if not practically no one will ever see today&#8217;s earlier post&#8217;. now though, huh, i&#8217;m already thinking about extending the display to 5 posts at a time. woah, there, andrea.

anyhow, site re-design? more like site overhaul! check it out.. (and [tell me][1] if there&#8217;s any problems, once again, my nice web design guinea pigs!)

also, i did the sillyingly-unthinkable tonight: i deleted all my bloglines feeds. yup, the big d-word. i hadn&#8217;t even looked at my bloglines feeds in months and, as much as i enjoy some of those sites i subscribed to, i wasn&#8217;t in the mood to go through, in some cases, 200 posts for one site alone. so, delete delete i went. (it was fun.) and then, i added a bunch back in but decided that my number of feeds could not exceed the number of years i&#8217;ve been alive. (feels kinda similar to nancy pearl&#8217;s famous [rule of 50][2].) 

anyway, as a result, i&#8217;ve also come to three important conclusions regarding bloglines: i *will* mix up my feeds pretty regularly just so i don&#8217;t get stale on it all (once again) *and* i will use it primarily to see when new posts are, er, posted so that i can see the post in its own individualized and (usually) lovely design/colors/accompanying images/etc *and* i will try and find at least one blog covering my varying interests, including knitting, books, midwifery, web design & web standards, arts & crafts, children&#8217;s literature, and bolivia. so, with all that, [here&#8217;s][3] my list of feeds</a>.

also tech-related (though mostly greed-related), i&#8217;m setting up a [powell&#8217;s wish list][4], in anticipation of [secretpal 4][5] gearing up. don&#8217;t worry, secret pal, if you&#8217;re reading this, i&#8217;m mostly going to use this to daydream about money as well as occasionally send to my family hopefully just when they are feeling quilty about me being so all-alone-in-los-angeles. 

oh, that [tammy sweater][6]? *still* drying (it&#8217;s been *four* days now!) and that class i [skipped][7] a few weeks ago? i ended up dropping it last week, so that means not only am i only (!) taking two classes this quarter, i also have friday mornings off. thank goodness, i could really use the sleep. ok, that&#8217;s it from me ~ hope your friday is a happy one!

update: i will *try* not to write so much in the future, such long posts are awfully demanding, i know, but had to add that waking up to a cat peeing on your comforter *while you&#8217;re still sleeping in it* can make your fridays just suck. especially when said comforter is brand new and just *thinking* about its fluffy softness while at work would make me grin like a fool. my normally sweet and beloved [trouble][8] is, needless to say, in the doghouse.
