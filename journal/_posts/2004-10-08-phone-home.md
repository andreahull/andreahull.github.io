hello and happy friday ~

in an attempt to save some money, i&#8217;ve been thinking about dropping my landline (so weird to call it that; i never even knew that term existed till cell phones came along) and getting a cell phone. i use the phone maybe six hours a month on a regular basis, tops. and all those phone calls are to maybe five or six different people. but i still pay over $25 a month for my landline ~ on top of that, my number used to belong to a scamming water heater business and a couple of very in debt people so i get lots of hang ups, creditors, and angry water heater customers calling at all hours of the day. very annoying. a prepaid cell phone, on the other hand, would cost like $60 for the phone itself and then roughly $20 every three months. much better.

one definite problem is that you usually can&#8217;t get dsl (much less dial-up) without a phone line (that idea will be ridiculous in a couple of years, i predict) ~ but [speakeasy.net][1], an <acronym title="internet service provider">isp</acronym> i&#8217;ve heard good things about, can somehow get me dsl without a phone line for about the same price i&#8217;m paying to earthlink now. excellent.

but then today, i find this: [skype.com][2]. get ready, this is pretty amazing stuff: it allows you to call people over your computer. for free. can&#8217;t believe i&#8217;m quoting michael powell, chairman of the <acronym title="federal communications commission">fcc</acronym>, but here it is: &#8220;I knew it was over when I downloaded Skype. When the inventors of KaZaA are distributing for free a little program that you can use to talk to anybody else, and the quality is fantastic, and it&#8217;s free &#8211; it&#8217;s over. The world will change now inevitably.&#8221; (fortune magazine, 2/16/04) check out this [nytimes article][3] about it (posted on slashdot).

first of all, the application itself is free. then, it&#8217;s a [great example][4] of <acronym title="peer to peer">p2p</acronym> that is legal. using skype, i can only call those who have downloaded skype on their computers too, but since i only call a handfull of people, i think i can convince them to do that. besides, there&#8217;s also [skypeout][5] which allows me to call people on their regular landlines and cellphones from my computer. skypeout costs something, but it looks to be about 2 cents a minute. wait: 2 cents a minute!? and, according to their [rates page][6], i can not only call anywone in the US for 2 cents a minute, but also anyone in Italy, Mexico, the UK, Canada, New Zealand, Norway and more at that same 2 cents a minute rate. hmm. sounds too good to be true, but i will test it out this very evening and report back, promise. 

the only problem now is calling 911. i don&#8217;t think skype would work for that and though i&#8217;ve never called 911 (except that time when i was 10 and i called 911 from the bathroom at a chichi&#8217;s restaurant because i was bored ~ as soon as the operator picked up, i hung up, adrenalin racing. but then the 911 dispatcher person called back and once she realized there was no emergency, she gave me a long lecture about the evils that can be caused by crank calling 911. funny now, but i was pretty freaked out then.) ..anyhow, though i&#8217;ve never called 911, if i don&#8217;t have it if/when i *do* need it, i&#8217;ll be pretty pissed off (or dead. yikes). so, more thinking, more research. 

(oh, note to savvy techie self: more p2p info [here][7]. and <acronym title="digital rights management">drm</acronym> articles [here][8] and [here][9].don&#8217;t forget [web 2.0 bloging][10]. also think about &#8220;In the future, peer-to-peer may be the norm, and we may look back at today&#8217;s client-server systems as some sort of weird, unreliable, transitory technology.&#8221;)
