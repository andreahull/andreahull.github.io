happy monday? hope so.. theoretically it&#8217;s now monday morning as i type this but i&#8217;ve sworn to myself that i will close this laptop and go. to. sleep. as soon as i finish this post, so really it&#8217;s still sunday night for me.

i&#8217;ve been all techie here lately ~ time for some pretty yarn, don&#8217;t ya think? .. behold, my yarn stash.

![my stash of yarn][1]

and now for some explanation..

  1. **1** cascade 220, 100% wool, ready for more felting fun, nice vibrant color
  2. **2** halycon pearl cotton, ready for [knitty][2]&#8217;s [hush][3] if i ever get up the nerve to start it
  3. **3** cheap lovely cascade&#8217;s &#8216;key largo&#8217; pima cotton/alpaca mix, for interweave&#8217;s knit [summer 04][4] &#8216;ballet pullover&#8217;, already gauged up and ready to go
  4. **4** $1 off-white mercenized cotton, was thinking of making lace pillow-thing from [&#8216;weekend knitting&#8217;][5]?
  5. **5** [green mountain spinnery][6]&#8217;s &#8216;mountain mohair&#8217;, need to buy another skein to finish a [sophie bag][7] (i love felting, can&#8217;t ya tell?)
  6. **6** my new rice cooker! just bought it today, and that is my buy of the month, besides that little yarn splurge i took last week.. but really, this cooker is awesome. love it, love it. 
  7. **7** classis elite star yarn to make [<acronym title="stitch n bitch">snb</acronym>][8]&#8217;s bikini, all in black. started the top but i still need to buy a crochet hook to finish it..
  8. **8** my beautiful poof yarn that i totally [frogged][9] after not being happy with how the [paris loop][10] was coming along
  9. **9** some nice bagged yarn that looked so spring and cheery, no project in mind right now
 10. **10** ah, my debbie bliss [slippers][11] (from [&#8216;simple living&#8217;][12]) ~ one is done and great, the other alas is much too large. too lazy to fix it right now
 11. **11** [r2][13] paper 50% off, was thinking of knitting [flush][14] or maybe [tasty][15]
 12. **12** bagged-on-sale yarn i was thinking of knitting along with number 14..
 13. **13** some [bamboo silk yarn][16] i couldn&#8217;t pass up, no idea what to make with it
 14. **14** ..so, with number 12, i was thinking of making rowans&#8217; [tammy][17] (from [&#8216;it&#8217;s a tape thing&#8217;][18]) even though the yarn isn&#8217;t that fancy tape yarn
 15. **15** [plymouth][19]&#8217;s sockotta yarn, it looks so clean and comfy, no pattern yet but i got out a good sock pattern book from the library 
 16. **16** three skeins of beautifully soft brown alapca yarn, mmm

and this is why i cannot must not will not buy more yarn .. at least this month. no, really longer longer it must be ~ i cannot afford to be a knitter at this rate. .. and if you&#8217;re wondering about the &#8220;part 1&#8221; title of this post, i have more stash goodness, consisting of mags, books, needles, and accessories. ay.

p.s. i have knitted a lovely something-or-other but am planning it as a christmas present so i cannot tell what it is, but i promise i&#8217;m not *just* a yarn hoarder.
