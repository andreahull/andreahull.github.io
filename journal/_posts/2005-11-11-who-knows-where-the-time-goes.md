<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="722" /></span> last weekend, at the fiber festival, i went crazy and got a lot of stuff: three bags of roving from [crosspatch creations][1], a [&#8220;totally tubular tube&#8221;][2] from [three bags full][1] and crosspatch creations, two spinning pamphlets by [bette hocheberg][3] (i love reading about the history of spinning and clothing and all that. by the way, if you like that stuff too, definitely check out [ellizabeth wayland barber&#8217;s *em\_women&#8217;s work: the first twenty-thousand year\_em*][4], it&#8217;s excellent), and a handful of old &#8216;handmade&#8217; journals from the early &#8217;80s.

unfortunately, since i got there later in the day, in time for the fashion show (very fun and some gorgeous weaved stuff), i missed seeing other online knitters, like [mj][5] and [julia][6]. though it looks like they got got some good spinning inspiration also, yay.

<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="724" /></span>and now some closeups of the yarn i made <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> the purple-and-yellow yarn is double plyed and the other purple-y yarn from the tubular kit was [navao plyed][7], which i&#8217;m growing to love love as my favorite type of plying. i&#8217;m still working on consistency (who isn&#8217;t!) and the navajo plying tends to smooth that out a lot. plus it&#8217;s fun to do and there&#8217;s never leftover yarn. i&#8217;m still working on getting the perfect [low twist single yarn][8].. 

the tubular tube fiber was really fun &#8211; you see it in these pics both still on the bobbin, and then all plyed up below. <span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="725" /></span> i highly suggest it for those that are just starting to spin and want to try a whole bunch of different types of fiber, prepared differently, etc etc. plus the color changes are very fun to spin and i absolutely love how the yarn came out. i&#8217;m thinking i have about 350 yards dk weight of the purple-and-yellow and around 300 yards worsted weight in the purple, maybe more.

and some random links: 

~ [greatest 100 internet moments][9] according to one guy 

~ [randomaccessmemory.org][10], i can get lost in this kind of thing for hours

~ [knowing what you want][11], been on my mind a lot lately

~ [good use for singles][12] and also for trying out beads and lace.. 

~ check out the [winter interweave knits preview][13] &#8211; looks like an awesome issue, especially the mulaks, &#8216;brilliant retro&#8217;, and the b-colored cables top.

any guess on the title of this post? [..insert jeopardy theme..] if you guessed it&#8217;s the title of the song by fairport convention, sung by [sandy denny][14], go you. this song has been haunting me, i woke up the other morning with it in my brain and the beauty and sadness of it has not left me since. 

have a great weekend, everyone.
