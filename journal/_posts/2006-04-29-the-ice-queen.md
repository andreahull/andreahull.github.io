      one of my favorite authors of all time &#8211; and the story here, especially the writing, is no exception. in general, i think hoffman&#8217;s stories just wash over you like a thing of nature, sometimes a storm, a gentle rain, bright sunlight, or with the speediness of dusk. either way, you just have to sit back and let it happen. what an inspiring writer.

      you also happen to learn quite a lot about lightening in this book and especially about the effects it can have on those it hits but doesn&#8217;t outright kill. just the kind of fascinating information a girl like me enjoys. kinda scary, but true.
