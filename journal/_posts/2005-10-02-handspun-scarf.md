finished: early september 2005  
pattern: [my so-called scarf][1]  
yarn: my very own handspun superwash merino, about 140 yards  
needles: size 7s, i think?

i bought the roving, and spun it up, in august, when i was renting the ashford traveller &#8211; i loved loved this yarn, so soft (especially in the wash, wow), and the colors just phenomenal. of course my spinning was, and is, very beginner so there was not a whole lot of consistency with thick and thin yarn all over the place. i decided a simple stitch pattern like this one would complement this type of yarn, and happily, it did. 

the scarf has the tendency to curl a bit at the edges, even after blocking, but it&#8217;s no biggie, still looks, and feels, beautiful. and knowing i spun up the yarn myself&#8230; well, it&#8217;s just can&#8217;t get better than that, can it? <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" />
