title: redesign fun

hello ~ man, i love this background image &#8211; ever time i look at it i want to shiver with both excitement at *seeing* snow as well as shivering becuase it must be so cold in that picture&#8230; yeah, yeah, i&#8217;m so snow-deprived, i&#8217;m getting silly, i know. 

anyhow, as you can see, (unless you&#8217;re rss-reading, if so, get thee here!) i finally did the big old redesign i&#8217;ve been [yammering][1] on about for a while now. and i love it! i have some nice ideas for the rest of the site (such as the bolivia, projects, fotos, etc, sections) to hopefully tie it all together but that might take a few days. 

i finally caved in and made this page display three posts at a time. the main reason i didn&#8217;t want to for so long was, at first, because i didn&#8217;t want to be a &#8216;blog&#8217; (for pure anti-social & slightly snobby reasons) and to me a blog meant a) comments accepted, and b) a descending list of five or so posts. then, later, i didn&#8217;t want to have more than one post because i was trying to be all neat and keep this page to an &#8216;above the fold&#8217; read (the fold being that invisible line where, if there&#8217;s content beneath it, you have to scroll beyond it) &#8211; but reality hit me after a while: i&#8217;m a chatterbox. and my posts were rarely short enough to stay &#8216;above&#8217; the fold. (maybe it&#8217;s due to all the ellipses and parentheses &#8211; i&#8217;m obviously a big fan of both&#8230; hee.)

and now for some credit where credit&#8217;s due: the beautiful image comes from that great free stock image site i just stumbled on [stock .xchng][2] &#8211; specifically [this one here][3]. i&#8217;ve always love birch trees &#8211; all the more since my semester-abroad junior year in college when i lived in moscow for five months. appropriately, i just realized that the photographer is [russian][4] himself. yay for russia and their beautiful birch trees. css-wise, i adapted my css from [purselipsquarejaw.org][5], a design i&#8217;ve been eyeing enviously for a year now.

if you haven&#8217;t figured it out yet, that menu/nav bit has disappeared to the [home page][6], as reminded by the little link in grey on the upper-left hand side of this page. the calendar & war statistics (sigh) are still on this page &#8211; you just gotta click on the links on the upper-right hand side that say, resepctively, &#8216;cal&#8217; and &#8216;war&#8217;. also, i added a &#8216;rings&#8217; thing so i could put in a link to the [librarians & archivists who knit][7] ring, of which i am now proudly a member.

in other non-techie news, i&#8217;ve decided i need to (not necessarily in this order): ride the bus/subway more often, try and make eye contact more often with random people on the street (for years now, i&#8217;ve been doing the duck-and-hide thing), and carry deoderant with me in my backpack. you live, you learn.
