funny, both of these words are pretty new to me, about a year or so, all due to these internets. <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> here goes, <acronym title="(knitting) works in progress">wips</acronym> first, most of which you&#8217;ve never seen before.

      project: syno turtleneck shrug<br /> status: i love the yarn but the ribbing is making my knitting look horribly uneven and so v. embarassing; this is my third attempt at knitting this shrug &#8211; the first was a total disaster, the second was greatgreat until blocking and growing about 7 inches ahem, so third time&#8217;s a charm, right?

i recently got [jess hutch][1]&#8216;s knitted creature book, so if there&#8217;s time, i&#8217;ll make one for a lucky nephew and there&#8217;s enough leftover kureyon to make a mini-booga bag for my oldest niece.

and that&#8217;s it. see, i do knit still! <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> and to also prove it, this weekend i&#8217;m going to a [l.a. knit-bloggers get together][2] i was invited to. eek, a bit intimidating, but i&#8217;m sure it&#8217;ll be fun nonetheless. just in case, i&#8217;ll be brining along some knitting mags to divert attention from my weirdness, if need be. hope it works.

and now, meme-time, via moni of [black sheep][3]: &#8220;List seven songs you are into right now. No matter what the genre, whether they have words, or even if theyâ€™re any good, but they must be songs youâ€™re really enjoying now. Post these instructions in your blog along with your seven songs. Then tag seven other people to see what theyâ€™re listening to.&#8221;

according to itunes, this is what i listened to most recently, some over and over again..

1. the night they drove old dixie down, by bob dylan & the band  
2. lather by jefferson airplane  
3. give me love (give me peace) by george harrison  
4. feel good inc. by gorillaz  
5. shake it off by mariah carey  
6. 21st century schizoid man by king crimson  
7. a plea for tenderness by the modern lovers

i tag the last seven-ish commenters: [beth][4], [lolly][5], [the feminist mafia][6], [julia][7], [karen][8], [liz][9] & [meow girl][10]. as always, if you don&#8217;t dig memes, no hard feelings <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> 

i&#8217;d add &#8220;life on mars&#8221; by david bowie and &#8220;crying in the chapel&#8221; by elvis presley too, if i could have a #8 and #9. totally weird mix of old and new and rock and pop, i know, but it&#8217;s been weeks now and it&#8217;s usually either this mix or silence. note: i love singing along of course, so the sing-along-i-ness of each song is key. (yes, even and maybe especially king crimson. i can sing along with a guitar, yes i can.)

it&#8217;s weird how this can&#8217;t be forced, but i think these songs from here on out will always mean to me this time period, fall and early winter 2005. i like that, but probably that will mean that afterwards i won&#8217;t listen to these songs very often in fear of diluting the memory. you know what i mean? there&#8217;s some songs, for example most lesley gore songs (and i *don&#8217;t* mean &#8220;you don&#8217;t own me&#8221;), that i won&#8217;t listen to except by accident on the radio every once in a while, so that when i *do* hear a song by her, i&#8217;m just immediately taken back to that time, that feeling i had, when i first really got into her songs. i loved that time period and i never want to forget those feelings i had when i was in it. with some songs, some memories, remembering feels like a bottle of rare perfume and i&#8217;m careful to keep the lid on tight.

have a beautiful weekend ~ it&#8217;s the weekend before the craziness of christmas, enojy it!
