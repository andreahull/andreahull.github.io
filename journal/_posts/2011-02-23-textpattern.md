when i first started mellowtrouble, in 2002, it was [as][1] [a][2] [geocities][3] [page][4]. remember those? i had decided a few years before that i wanted to learn html, especially after seeing a cousin&#8217;s page devoted to shakira. she was 13 (the cousin, not shakira) and all i can remember is that the site had a background of purple bubbles and boy was i jealous. so, finding myself spending a lot of time at ucla&#8217;s young research library without actually being a student there (yet), and getting a little tired of writing down all my web bookmarks in [these little folded books i&#8217;d make][5] &#8211; not that they aren&#8217;t cool, i love them still &#8211; i grabbed a couple of html books from the stacks and started learning what an anchor tag is, what&#8217;s the difference between the head and the body, html-wise, etc. of course i wanted a free site for all these newbie attempts, and wow just remembering how annoying geocities admin section was &#8211; so buggy! but it worked and was just annoying enough that i couldn&#8217;t get too intimidated to keep trying. silver lining, see?

within a few months, i had a bunch of pages all set up and i [started][6] [writing][7] [little][8] [journal][9] [entries][10] so that my family, who lived far away on the east coast, could keep up with, or at least not worry so much about, my life in california. i had started reading by that point a handful of blogs that quickly expanded to a dozen and then two dozen. i was happy with my site but was starting to feel frustrated by the lack of feedback from anyone. at this point i had bought [some space][11] on a server ( & was quickly [frustrated with my hosts][12]) and [registered][13] mellowtrouble.net. with the bit of coding i&#8217;d learned, i tried &#8216;rolling my own&#8217; comment system, and it worked.. kinda. i think i used [dotcomments][14] &#8211; no disqus or openid back then. it was [wonky][15] and i had to [figure out fast][6] some php stuff, but i was thrilled. for the moment.

i knew there were various other options, like the even-then-ubiquitous blogger; moveable type and typepad were getting big then too. i wanted something that would run without a whole lot of daily maintenance from me but that, at the same time, would allow me to get under the hood, so to speak, and fiddle around to my heart&#8217;s content. i&#8217;d learned in that first year or so that i really enjoyed coding, however basic mine was. i also was starting to appreciate and look for good code &#8211; semantically logical code that was browser-friendly. i enjoyed the logic of troubleshooting and just feeling competent with computers and the web. i didn&#8217;t want to give that up. i looked at wordpress &#8211; for some reason their version of the dashboard (wayy more basic back then) just didn&#8217;t appeal. i looked at lots of little <acronym title="content management system">cms</acronym> software that don&#8217;t exist anymore. and then i found [textpattern][16]. 

that was back in [the summer of 2004][17] &#8211; and i&#8217;ve been using it since. every once in a while, i&#8217;ll check out this or that new cms, and sure it looks shiny and kinda fun&#8230; but then i try to get under the hood, and it&#8217;s a big ol&#8217; mess. usually i can&#8217;t make heads or tails out of how it&#8217;s pieced together, or else there&#8217;s too many limits on what can be done, or, i&#8217;ll admit i&#8217;m a bit ocd, the code is just uuuuuugly. now, textpattern isn&#8217;t perfect and there&#8217;s [big news][18] up ahead in terms of development that is exciting, even if i don&#8217;t quite understand what it&#8217;s all about (yet)&#8230; but there has always been and there remains an elegance to it, even after all these years. i&#8217;ve added many a plugin (dozens, though currently i probably have.. well let me check.. 19!) and even that hasn&#8217;t diminished the simplicity of it. every time i upgrade, i actually understand what&#8217;s happening &#8211; which means if something goes wrong, nine times out of ten i can figure it out. i love that.

i&#8217;ve taken a lot of long breaks from this website the past couple of years but i always intend to keep this site around. made that decision a long time ago. (doesn&#8217;t hurt that i have lifetime hosting via [textdrive][19], who i [supported][20] when they were [first starting up][21].) so, when i was moving and finding it very hard to [leave l.a.][22], when i was frustrated with a particular [knitting project][23] ;), when my dad [was sick][24], and then with the recent [move to bolivia][25] and the [way-too-soon-to-be-here baby][26] news.. it&#8217;s always helped a lot to write about it. here. a big part of that help comes from just putting my thoughts down in words. i haven&#8217;t quite figured out why i do it online &#8211; and there&#8217;s loads, as any blogger knows, that never makes it online and never will. it&#8217;s a selective privacy that one day will make sense to me, i hope. anyhow, it has also helped to get that much-wanted feedback, from comments to emails and more. most commenters i&#8217;ve never met but we&#8217;ve been communicating online for almost a decade now! that&#8217;s amazing. and yet another definite satisfaction is from feeling like there&#8217;s a tiny part of the internet that&#8217;s all mine &#8211; that makes sense, that makes me feel consistent and efficient when i log in, that i can fix with my own bare hands (and laptop), and that remains [a steady fixture][27] in my life after seven years. 

so here&#8217;s to another seven years .. times seven. or more! and thank *you*, as always, for reading. these baby kicks in my belly (yes, it&#8217;s really my uterus that&#8217;s being kicked but whatever) are getting a bit more active so i&#8217;m off to putter around the kitchen, see if that helps chill baby out. happy end of february ~ ~

p.s. have you checked out the [waybackmachine][28] lately? [ahem][29]. they upgraded it and wow, it&#8217;s even better. yet [another][30] score for [the internet archive][31]. yay librarians. <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" />
