<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="1084" /></span>i&#8217;ve been all over the place lately &#8211; and i don&#8217;t mean traveling so much as moods and interests. it&#8217;s always been a wide spectrum, but this past twelve months has seen an all-time record high. i&#8217;m not going to write about the moods right now.. they&#8217;re not interesting to probably anyone besides me, and they even bore me a lot of the time! <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> besides, it&#8217;s my birthday in five days, i&#8217;ll be 30!, and i don&#8217;t want to look back and think &#8220;oh i was going through one of those freaking-out-i&#8217;m thirty phases, *that&#8217;s* what that was.&#8221; i&#8217;m not sure what this is that i&#8217;m going through, but i&#8217;m hoping for some originality at least. and i&#8217;m pretty sure it&#8217;s not connected to fear of mortality or wrinkles or that kind of stuff. <span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="1085" /></span>

interests though! well. they&#8217;re off the chart random. like [beekeeping.  
][1] and [letterpress][2]. i usually love that randomness, but it&#8217;s been worrying me a bit lately.

my mom is an artist and i remember her telling me about a criticism another artist made of her work a while back, saying that my mom needed to stick to just one medium and really delve into it, rather than trying out new ones all the time. <span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="1086" /></span>that idea stuck with me &#8211; particularly the small-mindedness of it, as i saw it at least. for years now, i&#8217;ve thought and said, there&#8217;s too much in the world that&#8217;s interesting and that i want to learn &#8211; why limit myself? there&#8217;s some people who want to concentrate on one main thing in their lives, one passion &#8211; i say go for it. but i think there&#8217;s a lot of other people who are too curious to concentrate like that. being in my twenties, it felt all the more true. i&#8217;d think, well if i&#8217;m closing myself off now to hunker down and concentrate on one interest, what will i be like when i&#8217;m forty? or sixty? 

now though.. well recently, i&#8217;ve been worrying sometimes that this is just an excuse for flighty ones like me to not get serious about <span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="1087" /></span>anything, to not have real understanding and/or opinions about anything (&#8220;i don&#8217;t know &#8211; i&#8217;m a beginner..&#8221;) i can *mostly* dismiss this idea, but sometimes i can&#8217;t. it&#8217;s somewhat cute to be all random-tangents when you&#8217;re twenty, but when you&#8217;re thirty and forty and fifty.. well, then it&#8217;s a little.. what, sad? right? 

i embraced the scattiness of my personality a long time ago &#8211; and i love it even!, but i guess the real question here is, with there being only a finite amount of time and energy in a person&#8217;s life, is it better to get serious at some point about a particular interest? how does one choose that? how did you? can you force yourself? do you even *want* to do that? or is society, and that critic, wrong? 

..ah, it just feels wrong. <span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="1088" /></span>maybe i have committment issues. ha! am i just the happy-go-lucky girl who doesn&#8217;t want to stop flirting with the town hunks, so to speak, and settle down to raise kids with a respectable boy? .. this whole post may seem silly, and definitely a bit loosey-goosey writing-wise, but i really want to know what you think. 

oh, here&#8217;s some pics of my bedroom to hopefully keep you from keeling over with boredom at my navel-gazing. i&#8217;m off with trouble to the vet to make sure her peeing ways don&#8217;t mean an infection. hope your tuesday has been fulfilling ~ ~
