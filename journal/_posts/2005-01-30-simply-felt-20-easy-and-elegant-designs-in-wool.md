## by Margaret Docherty 

this book is a bit more artsy that *felted knits* &#8211; and i like that. *felted knits* is hands-down the best resource for learning to felt, in my opinon; but this book expands your conceptions of what felt can be. 

for example, have you ever thought of a felted throw, all gossamar light? or a felted scarf, chunky and warm? or a see-through felted lampshade? definitely some of the projects are a miss but there is enough there to make me want to felt immediately &#8211; starting with their felted book covers, i think.
