i don&#8217;t know about you, but usually when i see pictures of me when i was little, i don&#8217;t really see myself in them most of the time. i *kinda* remember looking in the mirror and seeing that face long ago, but when i compare it to this face i have now, .. it&#8217;s sort of like looking at someone else. i never felt bad about it particularly, it was just that way. shrug. so, the other day i came across this picture taken in front of my 30th birthday cake and it just looked so much like the little me that i see in old photo albums. in both pics, i&#8217;m a little embarassed at the attention, but also proud, though i think my younger self was a little better at laughing out the embarassed part. my older self has better dressing style though. <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" />

edit: i took out the most recent pic because the more i looked at the pic, the less i liked it. anyhow, i&#8217;ll find a better one. the idea remains true, though i&#8217;ll find better evidence later. <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" />

(why the weird cut-out on the older photo? when i was around twelve i was determined to document my life so i grabbed all kinds of, as i found out later, unique pictures without negatives, cut them up into neat shapes, and glued them in a photo album. how i escaped my mother&#8217;s wrath, i do not know. )

anyhow, that&#8217;s my sharing for today. thanks for the nice comments regarding my new position and all ~
