      i&#8217;ve been on a bit of a kick recently, reading books about urban folks who turned to rural woods and farms, looking for &#8220;the good life&#8221; the nearings and others wrote about and lived. in this book, a new york couple buys a little bit of land in upper state new york and before they know it, they&#8217;re setting up booths at various farmer&#8217;s markets selling wildflowers.

      a good book, not too badly written, compared to so many others in this &#8216;back-to-the-land&#8217; field. i looked around online and it seems they still are around, selling at major farmer&#8217;s markets in new york city.
