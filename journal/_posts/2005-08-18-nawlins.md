i&#8217;m off to new orleans to attend the [society of american archivists][1] national conference for a few days &#8211; definitely going to be taking pics, but don&#8217;t know what kind of posting i&#8217;ll be able to do (but hey, if i could do it from sicily!.. ) and then i&#8217;m home to maryland, with a lovely wifi setup, for ten days. 

for now, some links that have caught my eye:

  * ~ [online library][2] &#8211; kinda like netflicks, but for books. we&#8217;ll see how long *this* lasts before book publishers freak out. 

  * ~ although i&#8217;m not much of a sewer, i do like [this list][3] of bag patterns, all free and most with pics to boot.

  * ~ i&#8217;ve been helping out with [christine][4]&#8217;s (of lelah fame) [new site][5] and been having fun with fonts: [identifont][6], [dafont][7], and [1001freefonts][8] &#8211; that last site is designed ugggggly but has lots of great fonts. 

  * ~ [making green roofs simple][9] &#8211; i love the idea of green roofs. wish they were *required* in los angeles. ([here&#8217;s more][10]).

<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="342" /></span>i get on a plane in two hours, my hair is full of hair dye, it&#8217;s 3 am, and i&#8217;m still trying to decide whether or not to take my denise needle set. but hey, at least i&#8217;m leaving my cats with brand new cat litter. <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> and tonight&#8217;s final project presentation for my IA class went great, yay. phew, no classes from now till the end of september &#8211; thank goodness. 

hope everyone&#8217;s day is beautiful! 

and cross your fingers for me that east coast &#8211; and louisiana &#8211; humidity don&#8217;t make me look like a dandelion.
