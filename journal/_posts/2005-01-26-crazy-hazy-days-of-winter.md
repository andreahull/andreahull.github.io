school has started with a bang and all is going well there right now (knock on wood). i can see why ucla graduates so many child librarians &#8211; [ginny walters][1] is a really really good teacher. she had a bunch of us practically in tears yesterday while she was telling a story proving how librarians can really make a difference in a kid&#8217;s life. 

so.. yes, i&#8217;m torn in all three ways: archives, public librarianship, and systems librarianship. argh. 

in other news, the education secretary has been making [clear][2] what her priorities are in her new job. ugh.

web site-wise, my site has been loading so horribly slowly the last few days &#8211; if anyone else has been having the same problems, could you [email me][3]? also, collette (of the funny and good [paperhat][4]) tells me she can&#8217;t see the entries i post here if they&#8217;re longer than a page &#8211; if you have that problem too, can you email me also? thanks.

[update: it seems like lots of people at my [hosting place][5] are having similar problems with slow load time so i submitted a help ticket and am waiting in line..]

here&#8217;s an amusing email i got the other day.. it looks like your average spam, but on closer reading, the first paragraph not only has a link to my *own* website (in case i need it, i suppose) but also took the first sentence from [a post of mine a few months ago][6] which, in this context, makes it a pretty weird sentence. in this email, i *guess* it&#8217;s supposed to make me think whoever sent this is in the same boat as me? bizarre, and thus probably computer generated.

last but not least, i joined my first web ring: [librarian & archivists who knit][7]. it&#8217;s still kinda small but will definitely grow &#8211; and already, i&#8217;m enjoying reading the other sites in the ring.
