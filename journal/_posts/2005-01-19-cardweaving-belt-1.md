this was done in a few hours late one night in 2002 listening to a friend of mine on the radio &#8211; my first cardwoven belt and, so far, my only one. it was relatively easy to do once i got the different tools assembled, namely the &#8216;cards&#8217; themselves (cut out of cardboard with appropriate holes punched out with scissors), a fork, a heavy dull knife, and yarn. 

i really like this belt, mostly because you can see plainly the progression made from a very loose weave to a more confident tight weave at the end, on the right hand side of the photo. i wasn&#8217;t following any pattern, just kinda turning the cards this way and that way. 

for more info on cardweaving, or tabletweaving as it&#8217;s sometimes called, check out [weavershand.com][1] and [lindahendrickson.com][2], especially the gallery pages.

btw, you can only buy 50 or 100 cards at a time, so i went ahead and got 100 of them, which is way too many for me, especially considering i haven&#8217;t done a darn thing with them for a while now. so, if you&#8217;d like a dozen or so to give cardweaving a try, [email me][3].
