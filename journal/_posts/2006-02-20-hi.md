<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="805" /></span>i met up with some fellow knitting spinners (like [rose][1]! hi there <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> ) on saturday and a great time was had by all. ah, thank goodness for the fiber arts &#8211; without them, my social life would be nil. every other week there&#8217;s some kind of yarn thing and it&#8217;s a big part of what&#8217;s been keeping me sane. and then there&#8217;s all of you out there who read and say nice things and just generally send good vibes &#8211; thank you! i know i don&#8217;t say it enough, but seriously thank you thank you thank you! i&#8217;ve been keeping my eye on the number of comments and it&#8217;s nearing the big 1-0-0-0 (wow). i&#8217;m planning some serious fun stuff to celebrate, so stay tuned and believe me, a fair number of you will be richly rewarded. or at least get a postcard or something. <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> hee. 

<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="806" /></span>knitting-wise, this is what i&#8217;ve got on the needles: the lace leaf pullover. lovely, no? (though my leaves look a bit funky in the pics, in person they look better, i swear.) after all my fawning over the pattern last fall, i&#8217;m happy to have finally started it. i&#8217;m using rowan&#8217;s polar, which i got for pretty darn cheap via [cucumberpatch][2]. i love love this yarn. it&#8217;s a wool/alpaca/acrylic mix that&#8217;s soft, not scratchy at all and light as a feather. the color is beautiful and calming, and the name, &#8220;silver lining&#8221;, always makes me smile. plus with just a little steam from the tea kettle, i can already tell it&#8217;s going to block like a dream.

my birthday is coming up in march, so i&#8217;m giving myself an early present by going up to the bay area for a full 24 hours, flying up in the morning, back the next morning. and guess who i&#8217;m going to stay with? [meowgirl][3]! very exciting &#8211; she&#8217;s such a sweetie and with her help, i&#8217;m going to storm [carolina homespun][4] and try out every wheel i can. <span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="807" /></span>no wheel purchases guaranteed, but definitely a lot of drooling and such will happen.* that&#8217;s in less than two weeks, yay.

hmm, what else is going on? still a lot of cooking, which is great. a bunch of good and sucky [movie watching][5]. .. oh! at yesterday&#8217;s horseback riding class i cantered! it was exhilirating and scary at the same time, so excellent.. i really love my horse classes, i definitely want to continue taking classes in the spring. i&#8217;ve been riding the same horse for weeks now, a grey gelding named [pepper][6]. pepper bites but i still like him a whole lot, just gotta watch the teeth.

[heidi][7] posted about this personality mapping thing. basically, i click on words that i think describe me and then you click on words that you think fit me, and then it&#8217;s compared. totally fun ~ and i would be really interested to see what you all think. [ try it out!][8]

hope everyone&#8217;s weekend was fabulous and happy vacation monday. hope you slept in ~ ~

**march *will* be The Month of The Wheel, though. that&#8217;s decided. <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> i&#8217;m hoping that possibly maybe someones (coughfamilycough) might get the wheel for me for my bday. hey, a girl can dream!*
