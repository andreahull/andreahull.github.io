which of course means i&#8217;m frustrated with myself. so. retreating, keeping my hands busy and my toes warm. tomorrow i go to boulder for a few days to spend some time with my little sisters &#8211; that will be most excellent.

just one of those days that makes you want to bang your head in a slow tap-tap-tap against the wall. not because of anything in particular, just because.

hoping your tuesday is not slushy like mine ~
