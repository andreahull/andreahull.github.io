hello world. a simple list for a friday:

1) good food, like the stuff i&#8217;ve been cooking the last few days: roasted red pepper spread, potato soup, and butternut squash gratin with onions and sage. tonight i&#8217;m making candied yams and tomorrow an eggplant caviar i basically lived on when i lived in moscow, delish. 

2) good music, like the great cd mix [tanya][1] sent me (along with an adorable knit flower pin, two artsy postcards up on my fridge already, and some sock yarn that i&#8217;m determined to knit into comfy slouchy socks, yay!). my favorites so far would be: well, i recently got into south park and so trey parker&#8217;s &#8220;montage&#8221; is hilarious; amerie&#8217;s &#8220;one thing&#8221; was in my head while i was in italy, so it&#8217;s great to finally be able to put a name to the tune!; be your own pet&#8217;s &#8220;electric shake&#8221; is totally rocking and i love it. dangerous to drive to, though. <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> i gotta say my fav is &#8220;angela&#8221;, the theme from taxi &#8211; i&#8217;m a sucker for seventies music, especially with organs and slow grooves.

3) lots of sleep, i.e. what i&#8217;ve been getting since quitting my job a month ago. it&#8217;s a good sign when you never regret your decision for even a moment, huh?

3) happy plans, like sometime in february i&#8217;m off to san francisco to just *look* at wheels, then in late march, i&#8217;ll be d.c. attending a a cool conference that&#8217;s right up my ally ([computers in libraries][2]!) also, in april i&#8217;ll be going to a [spinning retreat][3] with my guild, already put the money down, and will be sure to have a blassst. awesome. all three events mean meeting up with online buddies, so that&#8217;s even cooler.

4) and, the foolproof way to get cheery in a moment, [cute overload][4]. i love love that site, the pictures are adorable, the commentary is hilarious, and it just builds, one post after another. my absolute fav is [this one][5].. the caption reads &#8220;Au Natural. He&#8217;s totally smiling too. Can&#8217;t you picture him sliding off the couch in slo-mo?&#8221; ha!
