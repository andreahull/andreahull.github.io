1) replying to emails  
2) [one local summer][1] posts   
3) laundry  
4) posting four [book reviews][2]  
5) finishing up [crinkle and urban aran][3] already &#8211; one needs some ribbon, the other needs a zipper  
6) organizing bills  
7) finding out where my tax return has gone, sigh

but, how&#8217;s this for a happy photo:   
<span class="pic3"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="889" /></span>

i spend this past week in phoenix, visiting cousins and hanging out with my mami. here, we&#8217;re at a gorgeous lake in unbelievably horrible heat &#8211; ah, so nice to get back to reasonable l.a. weather. <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> for once, i didn&#8217;t burn myself &#8211; not much tanning either, but whatever, at least i don&#8217;t hurt now. anyhow, that visit was filled with good important stuff, but now it&#8217;s all about catching up with life here. 

it&#8217;s going to be pretty busy from now until the end of the month when i go to the beach with my family (14 people in one house &#8211; are we insane!) happily, i found two great new patterns to knit up using stash yarn, hurrah, plus a gift knit that needs doing asap &#8211; knitting just forces me to slow down, always a good thing. 

hope your day has been lovely ~ 

p.s. my cousin amancaya hipped me to some great songs, one very dancey that&#8217;s been in my head for days now, <txp:file\_download\_link id="15">see if it does the same for you</txp:file\_download\_link>. it&#8217;s called &#8220;atrevete-te&#8221; by calle 13, in a style called reggaeton. the lyrics are pretty funny, and full of english words you&#8217;ll get, like wiper, hyper, coldplay, green day, kill bill, refill, and more.
