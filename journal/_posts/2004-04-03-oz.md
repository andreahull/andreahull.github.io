hi there!

last night i watched [the wizard of oz][1] for the first time in many years. at work, we have a stash of dvds and, looking for something for my friday night, i decided on [the wizard of oz][2]. i thought vacya would be totally against it and it would just be me watching and singing along <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" class="wp-smiley" /> but he was all for it. it is a [pretty bizarre movie][3], and the technicolor just adds to that sense of unrealness (the only similar colored movie, i think, is willie wonka when they&#8217;re in that garden place and the boy falls into the chocolate river).. but it&#8217;s good! the singing is so awesome (and yes, i sung along, even with through the high-pitched parts, and there are lots of those) and the [lyrics ][4] (by [yip harburg][5], who wrote &#8216;brother can you spare a dime&#8217;) are great. dorothy is, as i remembered thinking when i was teeny, so *not* a child or teen or whatever. and kansas looks so beautiful, not the least because it *is* in black and white. [the munchkins][6] are the best in style. this time, unlike when i was 5, i thought a little about [the political allegory][7] that so many claim is there. (also, there&#8217;s that whole spooky [pink floyd&#8217;s dark side of the moon and oz connection][8].) now, i want to see [the wiz][9] with michael jackson as the scarecrow and diana ross as dorothy. i also want to re-read the excellend [&#8216;wicked&#8217;][10] by gregory maguire, who tells the story from the point of view of the wicked witch of the west. it&#8217;s really good..

today i&#8217;m off to the downtown library. downtown l.a. is really a crazy area, especially at night when it literally empties of people except the homeless and those waiting for buses. but [the central library][11] is gorgeous and big big, though i&#8217;ve heard that many librarians who work there complain about the lack of space (still!) and the building as a fire safety. the children&#8217;s section has it&#8217;s own pretty and rich carpet, with beautiful mahogony-ish furniture and nice lighting. oh! i&#8217;ll take my camera and take pictures. yay!

tomorrow i plan on writing up a food-post, to satisfy my yearnings for delicious food (yup, my fridge is slowly getting warmer and warmer so i guess it&#8217;s time for my bi-monthly de-frosting. don&#8217;t laugh). there are som many great food blogs and sites out there, enough to satisfy any foodie, and i know at least two. ;D (by the way, we need to have our next spaghettata!)

have a great saturday! classes start for me monday so i&#8217;m enjoying these last few days of relaxation..
