<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="855" /></span>hi there ~ still waiting on some yarn deliveries, plugging away on that shawl o&#8217; mine, and generally keeping up with school and work. as part of the whole eat local challenge, i&#8217;ve been cooking and preparing my own meals a lot. at least when i&#8217;m not clearing out the pantry of all the instant and frozen meals i&#8217;ve squirreled away inadvertently for months now. 

anyhow, i really like jae&#8217;s posts &#8211; she of [domesticaffair.com][1] (are you still drinking your lemon water in the morning? i&#8217;ve been semi-successful with that, but lately a bit slacking.) and recently she wrote about making friends with salads. yeah. now *i&#8217;m* totally willing to be friends, it&#8217;s just that salads aren&#8217;t very friendly to *me*. no fat, no grease, just green and supposedly so yummy and so good for you and blah blah blah. but! i forgot about a friend we have in common: croutons. <span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="856" /></span>sigh, now there&#8217;s a pefect finger food, a lovely snack, and the greatest combo of crunch and taste. (jae has a nice list of other things that can be added to make salads more palatable, definitely [check it out][2]. but in my kitchen, it&#8217;s all about the bread.)

deborah madison has a simple recipe for crouton-making in her delicious [vegetarian cooking for everyone][3] (which i&#8217;ll be forever grateful [liz][4] turned me on to) and, since it&#8217;s so very basic in the duh-slap-your-forehead kind of way, i&#8217;m summarizing here for your stomach&#8217;s pleasure. (or rather tongue&#8217;s or mouth&#8217;s, right? hm.)

you get your basic bread &#8211; any type works, i usually use baguettes or really any crusty breads that are just about to go stale. <span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="854" /></span>cut them into your favorite crouton size (i like big croutons myself), add a little olive oil to a skillet and toast the bread over medium-high heat &#8220;until crisp and golden.&#8221; lovely. eat a few. then, move the bread into a little bowl and, using the same skillet, add in some chopped garlic and herbs. 

here it get&#8217;s all subjective &#8211; i like a fair amount of garlic so for about a cup and a half of croutons, i&#8217;ll throw in two generous tablespoons of garlic whereas the normal person might prefer just one. then, herb-wise, add any herbs you like. really, it&#8217;s just bread &#8211; what can go wrong! <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> madison suggests rosemary, thyme, marjoram and, my favorite, sage. you can throw in a mix or just use one herb. you&#8217;ll want roughly a 3:1 ratio for herbs to garlic for the first batch &#8211; after that, you&#8217;ll know how much is too much or not enough, etc. so, just saute the herbs and garlic and then stir in the croutons. add some seasoning &#8211; a bit of salt and pepper, a little bit of sherry or red wine vinegar and that&#8217;s it. delish delish!

and that is how i ate this lovely little salad. i forgot how nice it is to crunch away and discover that yay, another crouton has been unearthed by the current forkful of salad.<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="857" /></span> yes, i eat my greens so that i can eat my bread. that&#8217;s the kind of girl i am. now, i just have to force myself to close the lid of the crouton can since the salad is all gone. mmm.

bon appetito. it&#8217;s a gloomy overcast may day here in los angeles ~ hope the sun&#8217;s shining where you are. 

p.s. gratuitous yarn shot for the fiber folks. that&#8217;s 315 yards of double ply superwash [mentioned][5] earlier. love it.
