my mom has been in bolivia &#8211; getting ready for the whole family to visit in about six weeks, did i tell you all about this yet? &#8211; for the past three weeks and after thanksgiving she&#8217;s heading back again. in the meantime, i&#8217;m taking care of the family house and though it&#8217;s been great to have so much free time to myself, it&#8217;s also really hard being in this big house all alone, especially one with so many memories. 

so, this past weekend, i invited over a niece, jesse, to come over for her very first sleepover. we had a *blast*! pictures [here][1], with some of my faves below. it&#8217;s amazing to me, still, how individual each niece and nephew are.. jesse just turned three but she&#8217;s such a little rebel, which you wouldn&#8217;t think at first, since she&#8217;s very much a quiet cuddler at times, especially compared to her siblings. like i&#8217;ll tell her, &#8220;you know you&#8217;re a sweetheart right, jesse?&#8221; and she&#8217;ll reply very shyly and sweetly, &#8220;uh-huh&#8221;, with eyes all twinkling up at you. it&#8217;s adorable. but now especially as she&#8217;s getting bigger, her sass and stubbornness is really coming through, and i *love* it. example 1: it was really hard to get pics without her sticking her tongue out to one side and making a face. example 2: i bought her, as a treat, a bag of lollipops and told her she could have *two* &#8211; she tricked me <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> into giving her three more (i&#8217;m clearly a softie), and then grabbed another two when i wasn&#8217;t looking. the girl was up, and i mean *up*, until almost midnight. ah well, i can be the indulgent aunt, i have no problem with that.

that picture of her on the our horse shetan particularly got some attention from her siblings, who all insist now that it&#8217;s &#8220;their turn&#8221; to come over for a sleepover. i don&#8217;t mind! <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> also, the six (!) bird feeders we filled up are already half-empty with tons of jays, cardinals, chickadees, robins, and lots of other birds i don&#8217;t recognize (yet) flying around constantly. ok, well, i&#8217;m off to look through some cookbooks and clean up the kitchen a bit, before i head back to the library in a couple of hours. happy weekend (almost) ~ ~
