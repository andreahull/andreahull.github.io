1) dadadadadada-duhhmmmmm&#8230; SCHOOL&#8217;S OUT! FOR! SUMMER! SCHOOL&#8217;S OUT! FOR! EVAHH! ok, well, not for *ever* but for a while. and that is good good news. 

2) i found some PHILDAR yarn at a local yarn store &#8211; and even though they only have two lines &#8211; phil eponge and phil .. oh, something else, i&#8217;m forgettting now, &#8211; i&#8217;m going back and getting a ton. i got five beautiful eponge balls for now in a gorgeous lilac. i can&#8217;t remember off hand which patterns called for it but i remember seeing eponge in almost all the patterns i liked. hip hip hooray! 

3) scored some rowan&#8217;s all seasons cotton half-off. can i have a &#8216;sweeeeet&#8217;?! definitely going to be seeing some pretty baby clothing in gorgeous cotton.

4) i finally sent off my thank you gifts to all those who helped me out the other day &#8211; and my stash has been properly destashed now! hence all the re-stashing. <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" />

5) it&#8217;s the weekend. despite all kinds of other crap-o-la, i&#8217;m happy about that. very happy.

6) online funny things are keeping me amused on a busy friday, like [this][1], a clip of a newswoman farting on air, and [this][2], the great threadbared site, particularly [this one][3] and [the pattern erotica one][4]. all so great, the perfect pick-me-ups. <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" />

and [winnie][5] tagged me for a book meme &#8211; here it is.. it was fun filling it out, makes a bookworm&#8217;s heart beat a little faster.

~ Total number of books I own?  
uuffff, happily too too many. i have maybe three hundred or so at my parent&#8217;s home in maryland. then here in l.a. i have probably another three hundred. i&#8217;m book crazy, yes.

~ The last book I bought?  
same as winnine, teva durham&#8217;s *loop-d-loop*. i don&#8217;t usually buy books, not recently at least, but i use the l.a. library system like no one &#8211; just got a haul today, including yann martel&#8217;s *the life of pi*, *black thorn, white rose*, an anthology of fairy tale adaptations edited by the excellent ellen datlow and terri windling, and *trouble and her friends* by melissa scott, a sci fi book that mainly appealed to me because the protagonist&#8217;s name is the same as my lovely cat, trouble.

~ The last book I read?  
*north* by donna jo napoli. so good i was pacing at the end, and i kept stopping and laughing at the happiness and enthusiasm i was feeling all over just because the book was that good and fun to read. it must have been such a kick to write &#8211; i so want donna jo napoli&#8217;s job some day. 

~ 5 books that mean a lot to me?  
horrible question, the type that can only cause one to flail hands in exasperation and frustration. so.. here&#8217;s five that just ocurred to me for no clear reason:

  * ~ alice hoffman&#8217;s [*the probable future*][6] &#8211; realized i love magical realism so
  * ~ robin mckinley&#8217;s *blue sword* -really, *anything* by her
  * ~ *the princess and the goblin* &#8211; i love old children&#8217;s classics
  * ~ *the dragonwings trilogy* by anne mccaffrey &#8211; started my love of scifi & fantasy
  * ~ chistopher alexander&#8217;s *the tripod trilogy* &#8211; started my love of dystopias. really. 

~ Tag 5 people:   
if you want to do this, please consider yourself tagged. i know memes can sometimes get annoying, but this one i think is never annoying &#8211; i *love* reading other people&#8217;s reading lists. update: [lalitha][7]! maybe [sandy][8]? anyone else? <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" />
