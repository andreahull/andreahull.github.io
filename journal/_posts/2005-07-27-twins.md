i couldn&#8217;t resist a pic of their gorgeous older sis kiyra &#8211; i can&#8217;t believe how much she&#8217;s grown since i&#8217;ve seen her [last][1]!

my sister asked me to be godmother to one of them ~ and of course i couldn&#8217;t pick, so she chose jesse for me. wow! 

as for the names, jesse is my dad&#8217;s name, one she always loved for boy *or* girl, and since she was little my sister just loved the name jenna. they&#8217;re doing well so far, and i don&#8217;t know how my sister manages it, but she sounds just radiant over the phone, really truly happy. yay, she and her husband are so ready for a family, and it just couldn&#8217;t happen to nicer happier people. 

in just under a month, i get to spend a whole ten days with them. and i&#8217;m now an aunt to 5 kids! crrrazy cool, huh?
