<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="85" /></span>hello and happy mid-week to you all ~

despite what that pic to the right shows (first time using the automatic pic-taking abilities of my camera!), i&#8217;m in a very cheery mood for several reasons:

  * ~ today was my first day of class called [intro to info. tech.][1] which i&#8217;ve been anticipating for weeks, and which (happily) did not fail to get me all excited again about interactions between computers and libraries
  * ~ that same class ended an hour early ;P
  * ~ i&#8217;m going to eat & then take a nap in about twenty minutes
  * ~ a classmate pointed out a [great article][2] in the l.a. times reaffirming my enthusiasm for this profession i&#8217;ve chosen
  * ~ missing the boat last time and determined not to do it again, i remembered to sign up for [secret pals 4][3] &#8211; for you non-knitters, it&#8217;s a yarn-and-such-gifts exchange &#8211; or as a friend said &#8216;it sounds like a cult&#8217; &#8211; and for you non-u.s. folk, it&#8217;s international this time, yeah!
  * ~ as i type this, it has not been raining for the last 12 hours or so *and* the sun is out and shining. amazing.
  * ~ and the big news: as you can see, i finally finished my very first [sweater][4]! for the second day in a row, i&#8217;m wearing it proudly, happily, and a tad scared (that i&#8217;ll snag it, dirty it, etc etc).

the pattern is a simple great one from [phildar&#8217;s tendances][5] summer 2004 and it took a little over 2 skeins of <span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="83" /></span>[inca organic cotton][6] worked on size 9 circulars. i lengthened the arms by about 4 rows and i love the effect &#8211; it&#8217;s like a security blanket for me, being able to grab on to the cuffs at all times. the seaming isn&#8217;t beautiful on the shoulders (some have already exclaimed over my &#8220;pretty [puffed sleeves][7]&#8221;!) but i knew if i didn&#8217;t finish and *wear it* soon, i&#8217;d be in danger of getting very discouraged knitting-wise. 

my [same concern][4] i had earlier remains, oh boy does it: the pattern calls for a cotton/acrylic mix and i used 100% organic cotton. the word is this particular yarn shrinks up to (hold your breath) 30%! though i made this sweater in a larger size (it&#8217;s supposed to be much more body-hugging), i really like the way it feels and fits now so i&#8217;ll definitely be spotcleaning this sweater as long as i can.

update: hmm, while i&#8217;m waiting for some yarn to be delivered (hopefully next week!), i&#8217;m loving [this beautiful scarf/stitch][8] &#8211; maybe it&#8217;s time i tried some [manos del uruguay][9] yarn? (oh and i really like [this pattern][10] but can&#8217;t justify the expense just yt . sigh.)
