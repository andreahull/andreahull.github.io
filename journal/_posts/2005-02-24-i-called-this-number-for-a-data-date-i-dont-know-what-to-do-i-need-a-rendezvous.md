last night, i finally set up a [needle inventory][1] ~ i&#8217;m loving it and feel very responsible now. (and yes, i stayed up till almost 4 working on this and cleaning the stove, so really the whole night was a combo of responsibility *and* procrastination.)

next time i hang out with my sisters, i want to make mozarella using [this handy-dandy mozarella kit][2].

if you&#8217;re a firefox user, try this out for silly amusment: type &#8220;about:mozilla&#8221; into the address bar on your browser (without the quotes) &#8212; what you see is called an [easter egg][3]. oh, these open source people are so dorky, i love it. (for more info, see [here][4].. )

in general, like clockwork every few months someone relatively well-know-blog-wise asks &#8220;where are all the female bloggers/designers/programmers/\_____ ???&#8221; so, here&#8217;s two answers to that annoying question: [dontyoustop.com][5] & [wise-women.org][6].

[deborath merlo][7] makes available for free beautiful clothing designs&#8230; right now i&#8217;m loving her [1920s inspired top][8], [this reconstructed book][9], as well as her [cozy, reversible wrap][10].

that&#8217;s a wrap &#8212; and here&#8217;s hoping i have some pics of a finished project tomorrow..
