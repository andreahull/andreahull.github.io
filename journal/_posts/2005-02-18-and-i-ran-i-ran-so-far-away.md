oh, i *tried*, believe me, i tried to have something knitted to show for today but it&#8217;s now almost 1 am and i surrender. i&#8217;ve had a hunch for a while that i knit weird &#8211; i think it might be something like [combined knitting][1] but i&#8217;m not sure. i knit, and purl, with both hands &#8211; in other words, the right side of the project is always facing me &#8211; it just feels more comfortable that way.. and so tonight, while trying to finish up my first sock, i realized i&#8217;d been doing ssk wrong this whole time: they were coming out exactly like my k2tog. 

the problem is that my all my knitting projects didn&#8217;t really require much in terms of shaping so i just never realized it (though i had hunches i quickly dismissed).. anyhow, my brain is fried and my hands are dry from all this knitting&#8212;and my poor toe was frogged no less than three times. i feel guilty having a secret pal and all and not having *any* knitting to show for days now. ah, it&#8217;s all about [the process][2], i know, i know. i&#8217;ll tackle it tomorrow. maybe. 

in the meantime, the talented [jessica][3] has tagged me for a meme, and boy, when i heard that, i felt a giddy thrill of popularity. <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> sheesh, this along with the all-time-record-high number of comments left on this site recently, is making me very happy. thank you!

and now, on with the [meme][4]..

## 1. How much space is left on your TIVO or Comcast box?

ha, no tivo here. no cable either. and on a good night, i get *two* channels come in clearly, one of which is not in english. *but* i do get a number of television shows now and then other ways&#8230; *cough*[bit torrent][5]*cough*.

## 2. Have you ever bought a DVD of a tv series and if so which one?

nope. but i do have several, ahem, digital versions of some television shows i guiltily enjoy. don&#8217;t laugh/groan too loud, i *will* hear. ..so : gilmore girls and charmed.

## 3. What was the last tv show you watched before reading this message ?

ay. gilmore girls. the episode where lorelei is behaving idiotically- oh wait, she&#8217;s always like that.

## 4. List five shows you won&#8217;t miss: 

if they showed again, i &#8216;d lik to watch all of pbs&#8217;s house series, because i really enjoyed their [manor house][6] series : there&#8217;s [frontier house][7], [1900s house][6], and [colonial house][8].

other than that.. um, well when i was little i used to beg and practically cry to watch [punky brewster][9] and the short-lived but much-loved (in my family, at least) [rags to riches][10]. (anybody remember that show? my sisters and me used to re-enact their dance/singing scenes all the time.) i also loved [reading rainbow][11], but it more about the *idea* of it than the actual show which i found a tad boring. when i was 11 or so i loved to sneak a watching of [falcon crest][12] &#8211; i felt so grown up watching it.

but in general i don&#8217;t watch *any* show on a regular basis and i try hard to not to get too wrappd up in tv as a rule.. if only knitting didn&#8217;t work so charmingly with tv watching, that&#8217;d be a lot easier.

## 5. Three peeps to pass this on to?

hm, this was more fun than i thought memes would be &#8211; but if anyone doesn&#8217;t want to do it, that&#8217;s cool.. but i&#8217;ll name [amanda][13], [lalitha][14], and [heidi][15] because librarians & archivists who knit *rock*.

thank goodness tomorrow i don&#8217;t have to get up till noon&#8212;i&#8217;m zonked, and the &#8216;e&#8217; on this keyboard is sticking, how annoying. g&#8217;night.

eeee eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
