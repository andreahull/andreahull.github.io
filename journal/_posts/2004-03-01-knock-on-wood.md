hi~

my site was down all day yesterday and much of saturday too. i am mighty pissed off at my [hosting company][1] especially as i have gotten no word whatsoever from them, despite repeated tickets/enquiries. argh.

i had a test this morning that, knock on wood, went well, i think. i am now in the computer lab at school missing my afternoon class so that i can finish my afternoon class&#8217;s paper. i have three more hours to finish it and so far i&#8217;m pretty happy with it. more details on the paper (don&#8217;t groan, i swear it&#8217;s interesting, super interesting!) later.

mecurial-mood girl that i am, my weekend was still good. i need to learn to recognize that when it&#8217;s happening, not after the fact. acutally, i&#8217;m pretty good about that but something about papers and tests just puts me in an escapist mood and then i just can&#8217;t see the forest for the trees. (i always love that phrase..)

i&#8217;ll write more later and sorry for not writing (back) some people recently (i.e. sandra, nicole, mirko, caroline, and maria)&#8212;but i have a good excuse: my email was down all weekend! dang hosting compnay-people&#8230; mumblemumble, blah blah blah.

bye, andrea!
