      very very good. i&#8217;ve been carrying this book around for years now and everytime i&#8217;d pick it up, i&#8217;d put it down just as quickly. just a vague &#8216;um, no&#8217;, nothing more. well, yesterday it was a yes &#8211; from the bus ride in the morning till 1:30 last night. i did a lot of stuff in between of course <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> but still, a good sign of a good book.

      i make no secret of loving fairy tale re-tellings, and story of tam lin has long been a favorite. it&#8217;s full of the real magic that you can easily miss in most (ahem, disney) adaptations of fairy tales. the kind that make you realize the only correct way to write Faerie is with a capital F and an &#8216;ae&#8217;. a really good book and one i will definitely read again.
