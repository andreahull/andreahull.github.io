so, i&#8217;m sick. it&#8217;s official. saturday morning i woke up with a slightly scratchy throat. i&#8217;m rarely rarely! sick so i just tossed it off and went on with my day. i ate little to nothing that day because a) i was too busy, b) my fridge is a joke (albeit [ant-less][1], hurrah), and c) i have horrible eating habits in general. little did i know as i went to sleep saturday night that my body was plotting some serious payback ~ but yes, sunday morning i woke up to revenge: a very sore throat, an aching head, the phlegmiest cough you ever heard, and a dizzy &#8216;woah&#8217; feeling every time i stood up. my body is on strike. 

nonetheless, i went out ~ i sat in traffic for a couple of hours, ah i love los angeles. i hung out with a friend today and ate good [pupusas][2] with [curtido][3] and [platanos fritos][4]. i eagerly went to the library, empty bag in hand, only to find out it closes at 5 not 6 pm on sundays. argh. but then i promptly went home, snuggled with my cats and revamped the [bolivia][5], [women&#8217;s health][6] and [movies][7] pages, go me. also, i&#8217;ve ambitiously added a [projects][8] page where hopefully i&#8217;ll be adding stuff a couple times a month. 

which reminds me, it turns out [that blog][9] i linked to in the last post whose knitted stuff i like so much is shutting down. the author, a high school senior, writes that she has other priorities and unfortunately can&#8217;t put time into knitting and blogging right now. after the gasping subsided, i realized i needed to be careful too. i come from a family that when it gets into something, we dive in all the way (especially when it comes to getting all the oh-so-necessary accoutrements. sigh.) but then after a while, burn out sets in. it&#8217;s easy and fun being a beginner, but like i learned about languages, it&#8217;s really hard to progress from &#8216;i-can-get-by&#8217; to &#8216;i&#8217;m-fluent&#8217;. so, what i&#8217;m saying is that knitting-wise i have an overflowing heap of yarn in a corner of my room and computer-wise i have an aching wrist and carpal-tunnel-syndrome-y aching fingers and body-wise i&#8217;m doggone sick. B-A-L-A-N-C-E is a hard thing to get to, much less maintain, but it&#8217;s a noble endeavor. and a necessity if i want to do in this life all the things i dream of. oh so lofty. 

but really, i just need each day to get my requisite winks, five vegetables and five fruits, some (for god&#8217;s sake!) excercise, some talking and social (i.e. human not feline, as much as i love them) interaction, and once in a while some good old creative juices flowing, be it knitting, designing web stuff, cooking, whatever. if i can do all that on a somewhat reliable schedule (i&#8217;m no purist) and go to school successfully and keep the money coming in job-wise, i&#8217;ll be quite satisfied. i still have to figure out where relaxation time comes in, that is, time where i can read or vege or sleep or whatever just for &#8220;shits and grins&#8221; as they say (i&#8217;m quoting someone else, so it&#8217;s not really cussing, promise.) and there&#8217;s more, much more i want, but for now, i&#8217;m trying to stick to the basics that will at least keep my motor running, so to speak, so the other stuff i yearn for (yes, yearn) will at least be somewhat reachable.

p.s. my wireless network is up and running ~ so who knows? i might be posting this from my bed or my kitchen floor or my bathtub. very exciting, and somewhat titilating. also, comments are now formatted as popups, yay. i like popup comments, they&#8217;re much prettier and in general add easy texture to a site, dontcha think? oh i also changed the picture at the top there. aww, isn&#8217;t mama cat cute? but watch out: look at those eyes. see? she&#8217;s mellow trouble. 

p.s.2 in aug 2003, the washington post reported that george w. bush had spent [27%][10] of his presidency on vacation. (for more info, check [this][11] out and [this][12] too.) fast forwards to 2004, [this guardian article][13] ups that number to **40%**, or over 500 days. that&#8217;s a whole lot of vacation, folks.
