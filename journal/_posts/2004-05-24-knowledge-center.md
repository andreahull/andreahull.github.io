hello world.

i really didn&#8217;t like how the word librar* is being replaced by all these slick-sounding-and-yet-totally-vague phrases. one concrete example: renaming a library a &#8216;knowledge center.&#8217; grr, i don&#8217;t like that! so with that feeling in mind, i went searching for why this lovely cozy old word &#8216;library&#8217; was being replaced by the cold vague &#8216;knowledge center.&#8217;

having loved etymology for years now (and one day i **will** own a copy of the <acronym title="old english dictionary">oed</acronym>!), i&#8217;m happy to reprint the origins of the word library (according to [take our word][1]):

> Chaucer certainly can be thanked for recording the earliest known instance of the word in English .. about 1374. At that time the word referred simply to a room in a house where books were kept for reading. It derived from the French librairie &#8220;bookseller&#8217;s shop&#8221;. The French word came, via vulgar Latin libraria, from Latin librarius, an adjective meaning &#8220;concerned with books&#8221;. The root of librarius was liber &#8220;book&#8221;, and that word came directly from liber &#8220;bark of a tree&#8221;. Some etymologists suggest that this was because bark was used as an early writing material, but others think that the Romans simply had a tradition that bark had been used for such a purpose. Cognates are Russian lub &#8220;bark&#8221; and Lithuanian luba &#8220;board&#8221;, and there are cognates in the Romance languages, as well, having the meaning &#8220;book shop&#8221;. 

looking for the origins of the term &#8220;knowledge center&#8221; proved a little trickier: no dictionary definition, no wikipedia entry. in 1984, barbara moran wrote an article entitled &#8220;Academic Libraries: The Changing Knowledge Center of Colleges and Universities&#8221;. i couldn&#8217;t find any earlier references to the term.

my interest in this whole changing terminology came about from the latest [american libraries][2], where they mentioned that the university of nevada at reno just recieved millions of dollars to build a [knowledge center][3]. their website surprised me a bit: not only totally web compliant but, although the new center is several years from being built (2008 is the projected date), they already had all this info up, such as [why a knowledge center][4]. cool, so what&#8217;s their definition: &#8220;It is only through analysis of&#8212;and reflection upon&#8212;data and information that knowledge is created. The Knowledge Center will contribute to new advances in various disciplines by making knowledge creation easier.&#8221; hmm, sounds kinda buzzwordy to me, but ok, knowledge creation it is.

if i type in &#8220;knowledge center&#8221; on [google][5], the first thing that pops up is [monsanto][6]&#8217;s own biotech knowledge center. of course, this in of itself means zip (if it was called a library, i would still think monsanto sucks.) but once i started looking through the list of all the knowledge centers around, i noticed that almost without exception, all are corporate. why? when did this start?

what is the difference in calling it a &#8220;knowledge center&#8221; over a &#8220;library&#8221;? why not call it an &#8220;information center&#8221;, since information is much more value-neutral than knowledge. after all, information to me means &#8216;consciously trying to be objective, so i can make up my own mind&#8217;. knowledge on the other hand is something i seek from those older than me, more experienced, who i trust.  
maybe it&#8217;s all semantics, who cares anyway, blah blah. and really, as long as it&#8217;s publically supported with money, staffing, etc then i really don&#8217;t care. but i still can&#8217;t help and not like new gadget-y sounding name. library means books, and more. knowledge center means boring facts and lists and uncomfortable seats. maybe i&#8217;m just getting old though. hm, i&#8217;ll think on this a bit, and reorganize it later tonight.

btw, see [wikipedia&#8217;s list of famous libraries][7] and [this barcode decoder][8] and, so pretty but also so modern! and shiny! [seattle&#8217;s new][9] [library][10] and, last but not least, [this new article on bolivia][11] via [zmag][12].
