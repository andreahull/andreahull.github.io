title: missing l.a.

<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="795" /></span>for years now, i&#8217;ve been planning on leaving l.a. once i get my masters, and move somewhere closer to my family in maryland. not *to* maryland &#8211; i&#8217;ve never wanted to live in maryland, every since i was pretty young, don&#8217;t know why &#8211; but somewhere close-ish so i could drive or fly there for weekend get-togethers, birthdays, school plays, and the everyday things like that. however, as the date gets nearer &#8211; graduation will be in mid-june and i imagine i&#8217;ll leave by autum at the latest &#8211; it gets harder to really start *planning* on leaving l.a., not being here in this city that i never gave a thought to, never thinking i&#8217;d live in at all, much less almost six years now.

i&#8217;ve been such a hermit, in some ways, since starting school &#8211; on the weekends, given choice, i usually prefer to putter around my kitchen or sit and read and nap. so it&#8217;s kinda funny to realize i&#8217;d miss the city itself. new yorkers are famous for being really loyal to their city, talking about the rhythm of it as if it were alive. being the country girl, i always scoffed and thought cities were convenient but superficial and all kinds of other snobby thoughts. .. anyhow, i&#8217;ll miss l.a., it&#8217;s rhythm, the atmosphere, the familiar look and feel of it, totally unique and un-mistakable.

<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="796" /></span>*so*, in an effort to come to grips and really get a hold on what i plan to do &#8211; i&#8217;m a master at escapism! &#8211; i&#8217;m stealing an idea from [heidi][1] and starting a &#8216;things i like/don&#8217;t like about l.a.&#8217; list. once i figure out where i&#8217;m going, i&#8217;ll post a similar list for wherever that may be. 

sheesh, i sound so moody. don&#8217;t worry, i&#8217;ve just been feeling all emotional the last few days &#8211; stupid commericals get me teary, and all that junk. it&#8217;s all good though, everyone should have a nice cry now and then, nothing wrong with that.

these lists aren&#8217;t in order by priority or anything, and please, if you know l.a., add your own in the comments, i&#8217;m sure i&#8217;ll forget things. 

first off: i&#8217;ll miss these trees. don&#8217;t know what they&#8217;re called but the minute i saw them it was love at first sight (i&#8217;m a believer!). the booklover in me immediately sees paper and gasps, the russian major sees a type of birch and sighs happily, and the fantasy fan sees a tree whose bark feels like very soft cork and is delighted. hmm, that last bit might seem weird. <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> (though i can&#8217;t say i&#8217;ve *quite* given up on the idea of dryads, either.) anyhow, i love love these trees. there&#8217;s a row of them on my walk to class and i always give them an affectionate pat as i walk by.<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="794" /></span> 

also, just because i&#8217;m proud, here&#8217;s a pic of some bread i made &#8211; last week&#8217;s banana bread, that&#8217;s still quite fresh and delish for breakfast (yes, i&#8217;m eating breakfast, chicas!) and then two loaves of heavenly lemony bread. made with cottage cheese, they&#8217;re light yet satisfying. though they could&#8217;ve risen a tad bit more, i&#8217;m ever so proud of them. they&#8217;re also given affectionate pats whenever i walk by. ha!

happy monday ~
