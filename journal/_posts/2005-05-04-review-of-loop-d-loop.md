this is one great great book &#8212; i liked it so much i bought it full price no questions asked, and for me, the bargain never-buy-unless-on-sale queen, that&#8217;s a sure sign of a hit. i&#8217;ve posted a gazillion photos here, i know, but you should&#8217;ve seen what i started out with! 

i&#8217;ve loved [teva durham][1]&#8216;s designs for a while now &#8212; not only from *scarf style* but interweave&#8217;s knits too. a couple of these patterns were familiar &#8212; there&#8217;s a short-sleeved version of a ballet pullover featured in a recent IK, as well as a ruffles scarf version similar to the one in *scarf style*. some of these patterns have been up on her site for a while now &#8212; but there are about 30 brand spankin&#8217; new patterns in this book. i also am enoying a lot her thoughts about knitting, and playing and experimenting with the medium as a whole, and is worth the price of the book alone.

btw, some of these have already been knitted up, notable the [naive knitter&#8217;s gorgeous braided scarf][2]. ..yikes i&#8217;m late for class, gotta jet..

p.s. just found out that if you code &#8220;socks&#8221; when ordering from knitpicks, no matter the price you get free shipping. gulp. just passing the info on, really!
