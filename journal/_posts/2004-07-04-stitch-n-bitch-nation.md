## by Debbie Stoller 

like expected, the book is really good &#8211; the writing is super personable and not condescending. a bunch of the patterns are great and i love how with each pattern, it tells you which skills you need to know, or will learn in the making of that project. 

more than other general knitting books, i find myself over and over again reaching for this book when i need to understand for the umpteenth time how to increase without making holes, what is a 3-needle bind-off, and more.
