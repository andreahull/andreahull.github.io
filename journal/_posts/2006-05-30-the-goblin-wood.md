      i&#8217;ve probably gotten this book out of the library three or four times and for some reason or another just never cracked it open. today i did and what a satisfying read. i usually never like books where magic ends or leaves for another world &#8211; they&#8217;re just depressing, like a magical &#8216;last of the mohicans&#8217;, sigh. but this oneuses that concept in a smart way, leaving a little loophole at the end which makes it all very bearable. the writing is good, the characters are real, the moral is true (things are not black and white and the ends don&#8217;t justify the means) &#8211; a nice quick book, pefect as a way to unwind at the end of a four-day-weekend.
