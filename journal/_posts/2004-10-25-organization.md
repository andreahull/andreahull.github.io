<span class="pic"><img src="images/13.jpg" width="50%" alt="[i love my new bookshelves!]" title="[i love my new bookshelves!]" /></span>this is what happens to me when my site is down for two days: i get super organized. not only did i get a brand new fridge (well, used, but it&#8217;s new to me) that doesn&#8217;t need de-frosting every week, but i also tossed the following things that hadn&#8217;t been touched in over a year:

  * &#187; old possibly-broken yogurt maker
  * &#187; crockpot
  * &#187; too small food processor
  * &#187; portable cake carrier
  * &#187; vintage (i.e. broken) bread warmer
  * &#187; a big tub of shortening 
  * &#187; some placemats i never ever use
  * &#187; wooden salt and pepper shakers that had more style than function
  * &#187; some old prettily-painted metal food trays

<span class="pic"><img src="images/14.jpg" width="50%" alt="[look at all that space!]" title="[look at all that space!]" /></span>and i got new shelving! 

i&#8217;ve been hankering for some more shelving recently but when i go to thrift stores, i never see the type i want. so, in a fit of inspiration, i went to a hardware store yesterday, got some lumber and bricks, and ta-daa my new shelves! very exciting. the top picture shows my newly-organized computer space &#8211; that&#8217;s my kitchen table and the fridge is on the right. now it&#8217;s such a cozy nook, especially with the christmas lighting. i love it.

i figured out that the more of the floor i can see, the bigger the room feels. so, in this second picture, it&#8217;s a pretty low bookshelf but the cleared floor underneath it makes that space just open up so much. these shelves make up my craft space, so organized! i love the baskets, just got them, they&#8217;re from [lantern moon][1], two out of a set of four.

yay.
