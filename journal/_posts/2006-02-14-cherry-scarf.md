finished: february 13, 2006  
pattern: [morning surf scarf][1]  
needles: size 9s  
yarn: my own spindle-spun *and* spindle-plyed yarn (yay)

this was also a quick spin and knit, all done in under two weeks. the roving, from [chameleon colorworks][2], was about 4 oz worth of 80% merino, 20% silk in a colorway called &#8220;cherry&#8221;. 

funny i&#8217;m not much of a scarf person, but this is my second in a row and i see no end in sight. for now, i&#8217;m really enjoying immediately *using* the yarn i spin up and since i tend to buy about 4 oz at a time, i&#8217;m kind of limited in what i can do. especially since i don&#8217;t do socks &#8211; not yet at least.

i cast on 20 stitches less than the pattern suggested and my scarf still came out 8 1/2 inches wide, which is plenty. blocking is so very satisfying with this pattern &#8211; as much as i liked the poofiness of it, the silky sheen really stands out once blocked. plus, it grew from around 44 inches to a little over 50. 

so, here it is: a light airy scarf that subtly changes colors and also surprisingly provides a whole lot of warmth.
