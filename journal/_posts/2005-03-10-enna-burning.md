## by Shannon Hale

sequel to &#8216;[the goose girl][1]&#8217;, i was really looking forward to this book. overall, i liked it and more than anything was very happy to revisit the characters and world. but.. this book was a bit of a disappointment&#8212;the writing was just not as smooth and complex as it was in the first book.

the first book took several years to write &#8211; i believe 7 in fact. this book, on the other hand, took a year or two, and it shows. or maybe it&#8217;s more that the first was based on a fairy tale and so had a decided structure to it, whereas this second book felt quite rushed.

still, i really enjoy this writer&#8217;s style as well as her creativity and vision and will definitely read her forthcoming books.
