i figure i’ve knitted a new garment for my baby for every month she’s been alive so far. that’s (almost) seven! with a few more in the serious planning stage. (versus my disturbingly long ravelry queue, “serious planning stage” means yarn has been bought and knitting pattern has been read. see? i mean business.)

1. & 2.i knit her a [blanket][1]{.ravelry} and [baby bag][2]{.ravelry} before she was born. i love the blanket, though i did mean to add some ribbon around the border. it’s amazing how much baby blankets are used. did not know! (also, meet uru, a great and super sweet dog. uru urururururu.) and the baby bag (as i call it) is so ridiculously cute. i added pom-poms because.. well, how can one not. it needs buttons for the winter, but i’ve bought two different sets and neither work. anyhow, she’ll use it as a jacket after the bag aspect of it no longer fits her (she’s a long one, this baby of ours) so i’m happy.

3. ok, so then, that first month, i figured out how to knit while she was nursing – it saved me many nights at 3, 4, 6 am when i thought i’d go crazy just sitting there, waiting for her nursing to finish (now, she’s a champion nurser, five minutes and she’s done!). anyhow, those first two months or so, i knit her three soakers, only [one][3]{.ravelry} of which fit and that juuust barely. the other [two][4]{.ravelry} (handspun!) still await velcro. (i’m counting these three knits as one since she they’re not quite finished and all are soakers.

4. next, i knit her [a vest][5]{.ravelry} out of some beautiful yarn i was gifted years and years ago and finally knew what to do with; my godmother finished the sleeves with some crochet and the whole knit just looks adorable and tough at the same time. she wore it a bunch, but i’m sure now it’s way too small for her. sigh. they grow so fast! sounds so hokey when old people say it, but now i totally get it. guess that means i’‘m kinda old. <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" />

5. then i didn’t knit for a couple of months, though i kept looking at patterns, sure. finally, i couldn’t resist this  (i romp, you romp, we all romp.) so i cast on in a soft beautiful pastel peach (acrylic!) yarn but have only finished the back. it’s hard to find time to knit little fiddly things (size 1s. seriously. :shaking head:) but i gotta finish it for the summer coming up in bolivia. (southern hemisphere, right.)</p> 

6. and that brings us up to now, where in the last few weeks i found a great craft store (the fabric! the yarns! the notions!), and so i began to knit again. one [pebble][6]{.ravelry}, that i love so much seeing her wear. it was quite cold a week ago and next week looks to be the same. i felt inordinately proud seeing her in something cute and very very practical: keeping my baby’s belly warm warm. i’m tempted to knit two or three more. so simple, yet so darn cute.

7. today, i’m in the midst of [a sweater][7]{.ravelry} that should be quite easy but of course i’m fiddling with the size and neckline, as i want this to be comfy and last until she’s at least a year. please! with all the fiddling, i’ve been consulting <span class="caps">TECH</span>knitter like crazy and learning so much about [casting][8] [off][9], necklines, shoulder hems and all that important pattern construction stuff. really interesting reading. knitters are so ingenious.

and that’s that. i’ve also bought yarn for two toys that i plan on making. pretty ambitious considering i really dislike dpn knitting but of course that’s largely what knitted toys require. ..for my baby, anything. i imagine i’ll wait to stuff them until we’re back in bolivia, as i have lots of wool roving there that would be perfect for stuffing, but i’d like to get the bodies knit here.

so. am i knitting? yes indeed. still loving it, eleven years later. !
