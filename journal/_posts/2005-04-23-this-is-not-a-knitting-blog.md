title: this is not a knitting blog

not that there&#8217;s anything wrong with a knitting blog, just that this isn&#8217;t one of them. i [started][1] this whole thing about two years and a half years ago in an attempt to learn html, calm my parents about what i was doing with my life (which is now funny cause they never ever look at this site, ay), and have a place to store links and such. in the past nine months, i&#8217;ve been moving more and more towards primarily knitting content, which is great since i really enoy knitting a lot, more than i thought i ever would, *but* sometimes i feel like if i don&#8217;t post about knitting, i&#8217;m letting people down, or something like that. there&#8217;s this pressure that builds up around having a blog, or even a web site at all, that is weird and also totally unexpected.

i love knitting.. don&#8217;t get me wrong, but i also love books (even more than knitting!), and geeky html and web design stuff, and cooking is great, and some political stuff gets me all pissed off and/or excited, and random postings and link lists are totally fun, and we all know i&#8217;m a moody monster so moody posts are just what i need sometimes to get things off my chest and be able to breathe a bit better, etc etc. (!) my recent postings on italy, and the lovely and enthusiastic comments i got about them, made me feel really happy because i didn&#8217;t feel like i had let *anyone* down, or that people were feeling &#8216;ok, but what about yarn?!?&#8217;&#8212;which would be understandable since i always talk about yarn lately&#8212;but still i&#8217;m glad it didn&#8217;t happen. ah, so what am i trying to say here? &#8230;

though i love love! my secret pal (and i *cannot* wait to find out who you are!), and the whole secret pal exchange as an idea, i think this is why i haven&#8217;t signed up for [secret pal 5][2], though i&#8217;ve been awfully tempted, and instead have signed up for a [postcard swap][3] and a [notions bag swap][4]. i know i tend to burn out, or just get all antsy, and i&#8217;m looking for some balance so that this lovely feeling of happiness i feel about knitting doesn&#8217;t go away.

this is my space and i need to feel free in it. while some people love, and thrive on, a targeted subject with their blog, i am not one of those. if you knew me in real life, you&#8217;d see what a random freak i am at times and how i, instead, thrive on bouncing around trying a little of this, a little of that. so, though i fear it sounds like i&#8217;m making big predictions here about some crazy (possibly creative) growth that in reality i have no idea of it actually happening, don&#8217;t be surprised, or disappointed i hope!, if i veer off knitting now and then.

ok, i think i said all this like i mean in my head&#8212;i&#8217;ve been thinking about it for a while. really these are just notes, i&#8217;ll try and clarify the thoughts later. lastly, this didn&#8217;t come about from anything specifically, just a vague feeling of unease that perhaps i was passing myself off, or this site, as something i&#8217;m not. does that make sense?

with all that said, now on to the knitting content <grin>:

~ for some reason i had an extra copy of the recent interweave knits sent to me, <strike>anyone want it?</strike>&#8212;it&#8217;s on its way to you, lori z.!

~ i bought some elizabeth lavold silky wool yesterday to make knitty&#8217;s [branching out][5] &#8211; only one skein, i couldn&#8217;t resist, plus after [lelah][6], i really want to do more lacey stuff. plum is my color of choice, yay

~ i haven&#8217;t done any knitting, i repeat no knitting, in two weeks and the withdrawal symptoms are bad. last night, before i went out with my italian friends, i happily sat for two hours winding yarn and organizing needles, somethings i normally would feel all impatient about.

~ remember that [teva durham][7] lace leaf pullover i was swooning about weeks ago? well, i&#8217;m still determined to make it. however, i was thinking instead of the wool/acrylic/alpaca yarn it calls for, to use rowan&#8217;s [summer tweed][8]. but, what color, what color? i&#8217;m thinking vibrant, something that will make the lace leaf really pop.. 

~ i&#8217;m off the ucla/l.a. time book festival&#8212;i have to work six hours today and eight hours tomorrow&#8212;it truly bites but at least i&#8217;ll get two days off sometime in the next two weeks. that will be lovely indeed. however, you better believe i&#8217;m taking some knitting (yay!) as well as some reading material (mark haddon&#8217;s the curious incident of the dog in the night-time &#8211; which was february&#8217;s selection by the [knitonereadtoo][9] group, and yes i know i&#8217;m very behind and that it is april. but what can you do?)

have a lovely weekend everyone ~ it&#8217;s nice to be back!
