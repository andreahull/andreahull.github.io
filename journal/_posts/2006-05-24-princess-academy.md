      i loved this author&#8217;s first book, wasn&#8217;t as crazy about the sequel, and with this third book, i think i&#8217;ve finally figured out why. first off, i really enjoyed this book (though her <em>goose girl</em> remains my favorite &#8211; it&#8217;s very excellent) but there seemed to be passages that were just so very YA in the least engaging/smart/interesting ways and then just as i would be getting frustrated, there would come another passage that would read like magic or wisdom, or maybe something of the two. it&#8217;ll be interesting to see how this author progresses in her writing &#8211; will one side shrink as the other grows, or will there constantly be this mishmash, which i grew to really enjoy in its unpredictability?

      anyhow, the story itself is a good one, with some nice twists, though somewhat predictable as in who ends up with whom. the villagers and their world is very believable and rich. the story also teaches a good story of tolerance and acceptance without being too preachy or simplistic.
