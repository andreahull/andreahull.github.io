hello there ~ 

first off, thanks very much to all you sweet ladies out there who sent such encouraging words to me while i was *freaking out* over that quickly-fading bad memory i titled &#8220;Voice over IP: A Business Intelligence Report&#8221;. (for those of you crrrrazy bored enough, it&#8217;s available [here][1] as a pdf. ) anyhow, it&#8217;s done done done. pheeeewwwww.

this is going to be a big mail week, which has got me all a-jitter.. my secret pal sent me something (can&#8217;t wait can&#8217;t wait!), that yarn i ordered is on its way along with that gorgeous rowan book, plus the phildar mags, PLUS (so spoiled) i *won* a book! 

it&#8217;s incredible &#8211; i &#8216;ve never won anything.. i don&#8217;t think so, at least nothing nice enough that was worth remembering. <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> anyhow, it&#8217;s a book i was really wanting to get: gayla trail&#8217;s [you grow girl: the groundbreaking guide to gardening][2]. i was the first to answer a question on her mailing list and in return the book is on its way to me as we speak. very exciting! (she has [other contests][3], so if you want a copy yourself.. who knows? maybe you&#8217;ll be lucky too!)

i miss knitting. i feel like it&#8217;s been so long since i last knit.. knat, [i mean][4]. i have some plans and with spring break coming up &#8211; watch out! yay.

lastly, the background on this here old site has changed. as much as i loved, and still love, those beautiful birch trees, it *is* the first day of spring and i&#8217;m ready for something different. so.. rain it is. we had some the past few days and today, when i went out to nature again with a friend, i was reminded how incredible its effect is &#8211; everything was just so green and lush with a capital L! i think rain is soothing, restorative, strong, lovely, moody, and, overall, hopeful&#8212;and some of these qualities i&#8217;m feeling and some i&#8217;m wanting. 

spring has sprung.
