## by S. F. Said 

read it in one night, such a quick great read. it didn&#8217;t hurt i was surrounded by my own two sweet cats, which made me more than once look over at them thinking &#8216;hmm, could it be for real?&#8217; this story is about a cat who feels he doesn&#8217;t belong in his blueblood family and so decides to leave the House and go Outside. 

the illustrations were just beautiful and i will definitely be on the lookout for more books by this author. very creative! also, this would be a lot of fun to read out loud between a parent and child.
