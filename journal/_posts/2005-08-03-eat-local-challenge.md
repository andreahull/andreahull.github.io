hey there ~ can you believe it&#8217;s august already? wow. 

about the &#8216;eat local august challenge&#8217; i [mentioned][1] earlier..

major obstacle: time. i decided i&#8217;ll be doing the challenge until the 18th and then it&#8217;s basically out of my hands. from the 18th till the 21st, i&#8217;ll be in new orleans for a work conference, hence i&#8217;ll be eating out, needing to schmooze and all that (ugh, i&#8217;m a really bad schmoozer, unless i click with someone, and well, then it&#8217;s not schmoozing, is it?) from the 21st to the 30th i&#8217;ll be home with my family in maryland &#8211; and that means a lot of eating out too. 

however, that also means a lot of cooking and food shopping, though, which opens up some choices, even if it isn&#8217;t my kitchen. my dad has a new mini-orchard going on and from what i hear my little sisters are up to their ears in cherries and are canning them like crazy, etc. also, maryland is corn-land if nothing else &#8211; fresh corn on the cob, yum.

so, here&#8217;s my plan:

1. Whatâ€™s your definition of local for this challenge?  
i&#8217;m going with the general answer: local means within a hundred mile radius of los angeles.

2. What exemptions will you claim?

  * ~ what&#8217;s in my pantry already *
  * ~ cheese. though i&#8217;ll look for local ones. maybe even make some myself?
  * ~ rice
  * ~ olive oil
  * ~ any spices i have already, including salt & pepper

i might add more here &#8211; hopefully not too many.

3. What is your personal goal for the month?  
starting august 1st.. err august 3rd (ahem), i&#8217;m going to try and have a large portion of the food i eat be grown locally. by large portion i mean over 50% &#8211; though some days i hope to do much better than that. in general, i hope to see how easy, and hard, it is to eat locally &#8211; both time-wise, money-wise, and other-wise &#8211; and with that knowledge, be able to realistically plan on how to extend this challenge to the rest of my time in los angeles. this is basically a trial run, in other words, but with [support][2], which makes it a whole lot more fun. <span class="pic"><a href="http://fogcity.blogs.com/jen/eat_local_challenge/index.html"><txp:image id="322" /></a></span>

one caveat: this is sooo not about purity, about holier-than-thou, about extreme anything or absolutes of any kind. i&#8217;m not into that, nor can i sustain that.

in getting ready for this, i&#8217;ve come to realize this challenge is a continuation of a long-held, however unrealized &#8211; until the last few years, at least &#8211; idea. basically, as [others][3] have written, i want to wean myself off corporate dependency. <span class="pic"><a href="http://fogcity.blogs.com/jen/eat_local_challenge/index.html"><txp:image id="321" /></a></span>

that dependency comes in lots of different shapes and affects all parts of my life. to a certain extent in this culture, especially living in l.a., it&#8217;s unavoidable. but the dream of independence, of self-sufficiency, of craft and knowledge, is old, instilled when young and nurtured by so many relationships since then.

starting from when i was little and my mom refused to buy us plastic halloween costumes and instead handmade us costumes (remind me to post a pic of me in my own [she-ra][4] getup, it&#8217;s awesome.) or when i&#8217;d visit my grandparents&#8217; farm and see on the wall the box filled with a handful of soybeans, corn, and beans, labeled &#8220;our first harvest&#8221;.

then, learning to love checking books out of the library rather than just hoarding my own (though there&#8217;s nothing wrong with a personal library &#8211; believe me, i&#8217;ve got one! but the greediness of the 12 year old who wanted a copy of *every* book she read? not a pretty sight.) learning i prefered homemade pasta to store-bought. shoot, learning that i generally preferred homemade *any*-kind-of-food to store-bought. 

so, i see this as just another step. i already don&#8217;t eat at most fast food chains (being vegetarian makes that easy-peasy), i try and buy organic when possible (trader joe&#8217;s makes that easy too), i try and avoid refined sugar (darn ketchup). i&#8217;ll be visiting local farmer&#8217;s markets, trying out a home delivery service, and hopefully cooking up delicious new recipes &#8211; i went a little crazy the other day and put a ton of great-sounding vegetarian cookbooks on hold at the library. yay!

*happily, i&#8217;m almost done with my pantry stash. all that&#8217;s left are canned pineapples (years and years old), a ton of dried beans, instant mashed potatoes, and cereal. ay, what a list, huh? <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" />
