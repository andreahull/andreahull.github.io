as of 7:50 tonight. i subscribe to the whole birthday month idea, so there will be more celebrating-me posts to come. <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> for now, i just started a fire, am cuddling down with some nice cats and dogs, looking through a pile of books, eating a lot of feta in brine with bread, and lots of staring at the moon too.

happy march fourth ~ ~
