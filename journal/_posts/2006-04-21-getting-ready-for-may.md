[<span class="pic"><txp:image id="852" /></span>][1]why? it&#8217;s the beginning of the [eat local challenge][2]! last year it was in [august][3] and since i was traveling all over the place, it was super easy to get a bit lazy about it. this year, i&#8217;m determined to do a bit more. not that last year wasn&#8217;t successful &#8211; the challenge definitely raised my awareness of where the food i was eating came from. but, onward and upward, right?

for those of you who haven&#8217;t heard of it before, the eat local challenge rises out of these questions:

<blockquote style="border: 1px dotted silver; width: 80%; padding: 5px; margin:10px;">
  <p>
    &#8220;What if all of our food decisions for a month were based on what was available in our foodshed? What is it like to eat only what&#8217;s in season? What if we all became more aware of where our food really comes from? What if local businesses got the message that people actually care about where their food comes from because of the sheer number of people asking questions about sourcing?&#8221; &#8211; <a href="http://fogcity.blogs.com/jen/2005/06/announcement_au.html">lifebeginsat30</a>

</blockquote>

[for more detailed info, check out [eatlocalchallenge.com][4] when it debuts later this week; liz&#8217;s [excellent post][5] is a great primer too.]

there&#8217;s an offical questionnaire i&#8217;ll post answers to later, but my general goals this coming month will be:

~ aim for 90% of all food eaten to be locally grown  
~ find a good [community supported agriculture (csa)][6] farm, or local organic delivery  
~ research for the harder-to-find items like local flour, salt, etc  
~ go to a farmer&#8217;s market each week &#8211; there&#8217;s so many in l.a. to choose from!  
~ read more about the sustainable agriculture/eating local movements, like

~ vandana shiva quotes: 

<blockquote style="border: 1px dotted silver; width: 80%; padding: 5px; margin:10px;">
  <p>
    &#8220;The suicides of 25,000 farmers in India in a short span of six years are a symptom of the deep crisis in the dominant model of farming and food production. This system is denying the right of food and health to both the <em>one billion who are hungry and the one billion who suffer from obesity</em>.&#8221; [link: <a href="http://www.resurgence.org/2005/shiva229.htm">1</a>, <a href="http://www.resurgence.org/contributors/cntrb-s-t.htm#shiva">2</a>]

<blockquote style="border: 1px dotted silver; width: 80%; padding: 5px; margin:10px;">
  <p>
    &#8220;by their very nature <em>economies based on sustenance ensure a high quality of life</em>â€”when measured in terms of access to good food and water, opportunities for sustainable livelihoods, robust social and cultural identity, and a sense of meaning in peopleâ€™s lives.&#8221; [link: <a href="http://www.organicconsumers.org/btc/shiva112305.cfm">1</a>, <a href="http://ms.groovygecko.net/groovyg/clients/trueblue/vandanashiva_hb.wmv">2</a>]
