i can now track and see who visiting this page using google maps, [see][1]? [via [rogue librarian][2], yay she&#8217;s back]

and another new online knitting mag: [menknit][3]! i&#8217;m already thinking about the lacey tank ~ for me <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> 

i love web voyuerism: [people posting pictures of their kitchens][4]. the only rooms that are more fun to look at are [craft & studio rooms][5] ([what&#8217;s in my bag][6] is fun too.) [via [etches-johnson][7]]. 

in his latest alertbox, jakob nielson writes about [Weblog Usability: The Top Ten Design Mistakes][8]. some of the &#8216;mistakes&#8217; i don&#8217;t really pay much attention to (coughnumbers3,7and8cough) but the last two definitely caught my eye:

> 9. Forgetting That You Write for Your Future Boss  
> 10. Having a Domain Name Owned by a Weblog Service</p>
the last one, because when i set up [my first site][9] (uuf, that takes me back. there used to be a lot more there, some of it you can see [here][10]) back in 2002, i was always bothered by the popups, hated the limitations geocities put on me (no php!), and felt pretty uneasy about having all my hard work be somewhere else, where i didn&#8217;t control it. i definitely kept backups, though to a certain extent, i forced myself to say fuckit a lot, just to be prepared for the worst. once i moved to my own domain, i felt much better. though, if some disastrous problem ever happens and i *didn&#8217;t* make a timely backup, there&#8217;s no one to blame but myself. gulp.

number 9 caught my eye because it&#8217;s the same question i keep thinking about [on and off][11] for months now. for now, my full name appears on this site, as well as my employer&#8217;s name, my general geographic location, etc. i *used* to post my whole resume, including phone number and address, but i got rid of that. i just don&#8217;t know which way to go in terms of privacy versus disclosure. 

i sure wouldn&#8217;t want to work somewhere where i could be *fired* for the things i&#8217;ve written here, that would be ridiculous! *but* i also know that as more and more people in my &#8216;real&#8217; life (no offense, dear readers!) know about this site, the more nervous i get about posting about sad stuff or really anything negative. in reality, i tend to be a person who keeps her cards close to her chest, you know what i mean? so here, this very public thing is such a release, an escape. but in some ways now, that&#8217;s diminishing. hm. 

anyhow, no answers, just out loud wonderings. 

when i was little &#8211; like all kids, i&#8217;m thinking &#8211; i loved loved twinkies. i tried out a few months ago and it was disgusting. now, i still love junky food (i.e. sour candy of any type!) but i was really surprised with how bad that twinkie tasted. ugh. and for some reason, i *still* keep thinking about it. 

i want a &#8220;organize your life&#8221; software. really! at the very least, any recommendations on good and cheap/free mac applications that help with any/all of the following: budgeting, schedules, to-do listing, shopping, etc? 

thanks ~ and on the horizon: an actual finished knitting thing! some pics of my ugly but fragrant soap (i&#8217;m thinking [soap felting][12]..) & more.
