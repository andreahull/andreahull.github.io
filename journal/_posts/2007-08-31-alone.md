i just dropped my parents off at the airport &#8211; they&#8217;re off to bolivia for three weeks &#8211; and i&#8217;m so excited to have the house alone. i love being with my family, but i&#8217;m definitely an introvert at heart, which means i love *alone*-time a whole lot. i had it in spades in l.a., sometimes too much in fact, but here i&#8217;ve had very very littles. so! of course i filled up my schedule with library gigs and there&#8217;s so much paper-related stuff to do as well, but i&#8217;m psyched nonetheless. i&#8217;m meeting up with an old college friend tomorrow and having some friends over on sunday for a little pool party but tonight, and every night for the next few weeks, i get to sit around, read, eat, and do anything i darn well please in absolute solitude. hooray, hooray.

pics: three of the little book i made for my dad&#8217;s birthday, of which i&#8217;m inordinately proud: there&#8217;s three different types of handmade paper there; it&#8217;s a new-to-me bookbinding pattern; and in it i wrote a list of fantasy books to read after he&#8217;s finished the harry potter series.

and these last two pics are the beginning steps to a big project i&#8217;m working on &#8211; one i alluded to in the previous post. i&#8217;m cutting up perfectly nice fabric into little scraps (proudly stored in my handmade basket, yay) &#8211; any ideas as to what i&#8217;m up to? a little something in the mail for the first person who guesses correctly.. extra points if you can tell me what kind of fabric it is too. <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" />

it&#8217;s been a pretty hectic and not-too-great week so i&#8217;m very much looking forward to the long weekend. i&#8217;m afraid patience is not my strong suit at *all* & i&#8217;ve been giving in to my snappy side a bit too much recently. all the more reason for some serious recharging *alone*. ! 

happy end-of-august to each of you ~
