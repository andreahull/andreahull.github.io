pattern: lacy baby bonnet from erika knight&#8217;s &#8220;knitting for two&#8221;  
yarn: 1 skein of debbie bliss&#8217;s cashmerino, just barely off-white.   
needles: size 5 bamboo straights 

this was a great quick project with beautiful results if i do say so myself! <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> i knit up the bonnet in one night &#8211; about four hours &#8211; and the mittens on another knight in under two hours. 

the recommended yarn was debbie bliss&#8217; wool/cotton but i didn&#8217;t like the colors i was finding so i went with the cashmerino instead. i think it&#8217;s a little floppier than the wool/cotton would have been, but it doesn&#8217;t make a difference really. also, a bonus, the bonnet only needed one skein, and at that, there was more than enough for a pair of mittens!

this is the first knits for my brand-new niece, kiyra &#8211; she&#8217;s being baptised this weekend and i just know she&#8217;ll look adorable wearing them &#8211; plus she&#8217;ll always have them as a reminder of how much her aunt loves her, awww.

oh, the pattern calls for a big old-fashioned ribbon but i didn&#8217;t like the look that much so i just added some i-cords which worked out perfectly, i think. i was tempted to add a bobble at the back of the bonnet, in the middle of the flower/star but i resisted. <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" />
