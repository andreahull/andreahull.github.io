first off, <span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="727" /></span>check out the brand new spinning magazine [spindlicity][1]! janel, one of our [local l.a. spinners][2], has done a tremendous beautiful job. go ahead and look, i&#8217;ll wait. <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> there&#8217;s a lot of good stuff there &#8211; patterns, article and more, including an article by [julia][3] perfect for those who want to get into spinning but don&#8217;t know where to start. ..oh, and you might see some pics that look familiar in the reader&#8217;s gallery section, yay! 

in the same spinning spirit, here are some photos from my last spinning rental, mmm. <span class="picl"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="728" /></span>i love how this batch of yarn came out! definitely getting better at the spinning thing and i must say the majacraft rose is a dream to spin on &#8211; quiet as a mouse, no oiling in over two weeks of regular spinning, incredible rations, smooth treadling and very pretty to boot. 

first off, the gorgeous red and orange roving that was from my [stitch ya neck out][4] pal bethieee. <span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="729" /></span>   
and that&#8217;s not all she sent &#8211; see that cute handmade cat? she also sent the some pink roving that i wish i&#8217;d taken a close up of, it was the prettiest deep pink with this occasional creamy white stripe, so lovely. i was so excited when i got the package, i sat straight down and spun all the fiber up. in my excitement, i totally forgot to even thank her till now! bad me, very bad. thank you [bethieee][5]!!

some experiments were done here.. first off, the striped chunky yarn was my first try at spinning thick. <span class="picl"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="731" /></span>some beginning knitters spin thick, some thin, and i&#8217;m the latter category. but i absolutely love some thick yarn i see (especially on the excellent [live journal &#8216;spinning fiber&#8217; community][6])   
and so wanted to see if i could spin do it too. it was hard but all in all, i was really happy with the results. and honestly, i was squealing a good majority of the time i was plying, that was *so* very much fun.

then, some felted soap as you see &#8211; ta daa! that&#8217;s my soap i talked about [a while back][7] &#8211; it lathers beautifully, smells very clean ;), but was fugly as can be. so! <span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="730" /></span>[felted soap][8] it had to be. what a great great way to use up bits of fiber. i definitely will be making more of these, that&#8217;s for sure. chicas, if you&#8217;re reading this, these are my stocking stuffers for the family &#8211; cool, huh? <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> (ten points to anyone guessing which one was the first felted soap..!)

lastly, my pride and joy would be these low twist singles &#8211; first off, some hand-dyed superwash from a store in the valley, then slow careful treadling, excited winding on the niddy-noddy, and finally a gentle wash in the sink. ahhh! i love this yarn &#8211; <span class="picl"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="732" /></span>and here, unfortunately, the limitations of the web really show, for this yarn is the softest and cushiest yarn there is. i&#8217;m biased, but really, it is. love it love it. 

i&#8217;m once again(!) trying to organize my fotos, and so i set up a spinning album with finished pictures of all my yarn &#8211; including these here, [check it out][9]..

happy day, everyone ~
