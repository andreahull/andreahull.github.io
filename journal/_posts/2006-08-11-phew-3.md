<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="906" /></span>it&#8217;s been a great two weeks at work &#8211; full of interesting people, tasks, and conversations, but i am *exhausted*. tonight i plan on catching up on sleep since tomorrow i&#8217;m hosting a spin-in at my place with a handful of spinning friends. yay! 

ok, this is the only icarus photos you&#8217;ll be getting for a while as it&#8217;ll bascially look the same, just larger and more puddled, until i get to the edging. pretty, though, no?

it&#8217;s been about six weeks since i sold my car, and though my wimpy legs are starting to get pretty tired of walking to and from <span class="pic"><txp:image id="907" /></span>the bus stations every day (about 30+ minutes each way), it&#8217;s still been a change for the better. i know that illustration looks exagerrated, but for someone like me who gets pissy and combative in a second when driving, it&#8217;s been great not feeling that familiar road rage every single day, so the image fits me to a t. i&#8217;m waiting for an [interesting book][1] that reinforces these feelings, and in the meanwhile, this list of [carfree places][2] in the world is fascinating.

i love riding the bus &#8211; i don&#8217;t love standing on it for hours, but it&#8217;s never boring. and if it is, i can just close my eyes and sleep. hands down, it&#8217;s the *best* place for people watching and wow, one of the last places you&#8217;d think to see it, but people are so much nicer and considerate to each other on the bus than almost anywhere else, at least in public.

mcdonalds had [the idiotic idea][3] of giving away little plastic hummers in every happy meal. obscene, ugh. [via [treehugger][4]]

it&#8217;s [national farmers market week][5], which reminds me how much i&#8217;ve been missing fresh local produce and open-air markets.. i&#8217;m so far behind on the eat local summer, it&#8217;s not even funny &#8211; things have been wayy too chaotic for me to be able to participate, what a total bummer. *but* i haven&#8217;t entirely given up yet..
