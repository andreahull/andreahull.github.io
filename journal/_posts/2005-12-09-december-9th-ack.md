hi there ~ it&#8217;s been a very busy week and i still have two papers due monday and tuesday so this weekend will be busybusy too, but i still feel like a big part of the craziness is over. 

of course, my knitting is wayyyy behind schedule &#8211; both christmas knitting and swap knitting. i&#8217;m totally embarassed to say i *still* owe my stitch ya neck out pal her scarf &#8211; not cool! i&#8217;m sorry! the recipient-to-be is cassie of [autumn sweater][1], whose [tubey][2] in the latest knitty is generating a ton of well-earned compliments. isn&#8217;t it so cute looking! so, progress report: since the [blocking incident][3], i had to frog almost the whole shrug so i bought some of those mini clover circulars a few days back and i&#8217;m bringing the wip with me everywhere so i can hopefully get her scarf out to her before christmas. ay! 

in the biggest news of the moment, yesterday i gave my two weeks notice at [work][4] &#8211; geez, it felt so good! i&#8217;ve been feeling for a real long while that it was time for me to move on &#8211; i&#8217;ve been there almost four years! and when my boss announced to everyone that i was leaving, there was a very satisyingly audible collective gasp, yay. .. so, my last day of work is december 19th and there&#8217;s so much to do in the meantime.<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="753" /></span> i didn&#8217;t realize until yesterday when i start organizing, how much *stuff* i&#8217;ve accumulated in my desk. i&#8217;m going to feel so FREE! after the 19th, in a somewhat scary free-fall kind of way, but mostly in an exhilirating i-can-do-anything kind of way. whee!

of course, me being me, i accepted a job already that though only ten hours a week will pay for my school tuition (yay!) plus a little extra and is a challenge i&#8217;m already enjoying &#8211; it&#8217;s as the webmaster for the [california center for the book][5], a state literary center. i&#8217;ve already tweaked the design a bit and did some major structure overhaul, very fun. i&#8217;m thinking about setting up a little professional site with my resume, examples of web work, etc &#8211; but domain names are tricky to figure out. for a professional site, should i go with my full name? i&#8217;d rather not since i&#8217;m not crazy about my last name (sorry poppy!).. hm.

anyhow, here&#8217;s two pics of my tree &#8211; i got it the day after the funddrive when i was dead exhausted and just needed to chill out for a few hours. isn&#8217;t it purty? <span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="754" /></span>i still need to add some stuff, and yes, i know, it needs a little something around the bottom, cause that stand isn&#8217;t so pretty <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> but at night, oh how happy it makes me! i lovelove! the smell of christmas trees. and christmas lights?! oh, don&#8217;t get me started! gotta say that lighting is *key* in a home.

hey, all angelenos, don&#8217;t forget this weekend is the [bazaar bizarre][6]! 

and that&#8217;s it for me &#8211; i&#8217;m going to do a wip-show-of-shame in a few days so that i will feel the whole public pressure thing to get. stuff. done. also, i got a great knitting gift from a friend, plus some packages are waiting for me at the post office. for now, i&#8217;m happy ~ hope you are too ~
