..only online though, hence this pictures-less quickie post. i went to florida for a week with my mom, sister, and two of her kids. i&#8217;m getting ready for the maryland sheep & wool festival (i got into the comprehensive spinning workshop with judith mackenzie mccuin, yay!) next week. i have tons of mid-progress projects going on, scattered around my room and spreading out to the rest of the house. it&#8217;s officially spring out here in maryland. and i&#8217;m making plans, oh yes, big plans. no more info because i don&#8217;t want to jinx them even more, but oof. ! 

this post is not meant to annoy with its vagueness, but more be a bookmark for myself of a point in my life where things changed and moved forward. in some (important) aspects, i&#8217;m happier now than i&#8217;ve been in a while. always nice to be able to say that, no matter the qualifiers and such.

and now, nice readers you, how are *you* doing?
