(p.s. i decided at the last moment not to go up to palo alto to see my sister&#8212;she was only going to be there till 9 am tomorrow and i wouldn&#8217;t have gotten there till at least 8 pm tonight. i&#8217;m sad about not seeing my sister but relieved to not have ten hours of driving in the next 24 hours. so that means tonight i&#8217;m kicking up my heels &#8211; i&#8217;m going to try and finish [laleh ][1]and i got out [babette&#8217;s feast][2]. i&#8217;ve seen it before, loved it, and am really in the mood for some [fancy cooking][3] but this will have to do.)
