about a year ago, i started this shawl &#8211; the mystic waters shawl &#8211; but it&#8217;s been in this same state for about six months now, wow. i&#8217;m determined to complete it as soon as possible though because&#8230; she&#8217;s pregnant! this will be her first (!) and we&#8217;re all so excited for the new little one. the baby&#8217;s due sometime at the end of march so there&#8217;s time to finish this, but considering how big a shawl it is and that i&#8217;m knitting it on size 2 needles to boot, there&#8217;s no time to waste. plus i would like her to enjoy it in the winter months too, pre-baby and all, of course.

here are some other knitting projects i&#8217;ve been eying lately.. though considering how many i have waiting for me to finish, i must not (must not!) start any new ones until i get a few off my plate:

~ [rose leaf curtains][1]  
~ [paletot point de broderie cardigan][2] aka very pretty cardigan  
~ [still][3] by k. hargreave  
~ [deep in the forest mittens][4] *  
~ [rambling rose][5] *  
~ [little birds][6] *  
~ [jacket in garter stitch][7] *  
~ [fresco wrap vest][8]  
~ & lastly, either an [elephant][9], [bunny][10] or [hedgehog][11] for my future niece/nephew &#8211; what do you think?

*already have the yarn. just saying, that&#8217;s all. some of it even handspun. gulp.

so, those are the *premios* &#8211; prizes &#8211; that i can look forward to after completing a few current knitting works-in-progress &#8211; but first priority is the shawl. it&#8217;s the most complicated lace knitting i&#8217;ve done so far just because the pattern changes so often i really have to read every lace line very carefully, and it&#8217;s not something i can memorize in chunks or anything. a lot of work. only for a sister, sheesh. <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" />

happy november! ~
