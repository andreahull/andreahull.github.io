hi there ~ just to give a break to all the moving/adjusting/moody/crazy andrea posts, here&#8217;s a short one that&#8217;s strictly craft-related. 

remember my [crewel attempts][1]? well, about a month ago, i bought brand new jeans that came, as jeans often do nowadays, all ripped up. no problem there, except one rip was a little too ripped, so ta-daa, [crewelry][2] at work.

the next mini-project was knitting up my [first homespun linen][3] into a set of useful [washcloths][4]. <span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="993" /></span>it shows my uneven spinning, but somehow that ends up being a plus. <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> i&#8217;d read online that many don&#8217;t enjoy knitting linen, that it&#8217;s as unforgiving in give as cotton, but i found it *much* nicer to knit with. who cares anyhow ~ it drapes beautifully, has beautiful texture, and will just get stronger and softer as time goes by. i&#8217;ll definitely be spinning more flax in the future, though what i&#8217;d really love to try is nettle. too cool.

lastly, since i forgot to pack any stuff to keep me craftily occupied until my shipping cube arrives ( *what* was i thinking?! also forgot to pack any clothing in my carry-on bag, but did manage to pack three pairs of shoes. basically i&#8217;ve been going around maryland nekkid, but with a nice variety of footwear. \* smacks forehead \*)<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="991" /></span>, i&#8217;ve been getting some nice crafting accessories: the first [craft][5] mag put out by [make][6]/o&#8217;reilly, the latest [vogue knitting][7], and i finally caved in and got that [quilt-it kit][8] put out by denise schmidt. 

quick thoughts:  
~ the craft magazine is outrageously expensive ($15!). the projects are unique and truly inspiring. the writing is less inspiring, more wince-causing & raised such questions like, why come up with a new acronym &#8211; <span class="caps">MIY</span> (make it yourself) &#8211; when [<span class="caps">DIY</span>][9] is already in existence? the D in <span class="caps">DIY</span> is broader, more powerful, and more disruptive to the powers-that-be than the relatively meek consumptive M. anywho.  
~ loving the vogue texture! all those cables and laces, totally fun. didn&#8217;t even look at the articles. the overwhelming ads as always are annoying.  
~ although i haven&#8217;t even threaded the needle yet, i can tell i&#8217;m going to like this quilt-it kit. quilting is pretty intimidating and this feels like such an easy slide into that world, though of course, with these very words, i&#8217;ve jinxed myself horrendously. the colors, the variety, the sizes (i like *small*. i don&#8217;t have time right now for a queen-sized quilt) &#8211; all appeals. 

that&#8217;s it for now, thanks y&#8217;all. i&#8217;m in the south (!), so that y&#8217;all is entirely appropriate. hope your tuesday is totally tubular, dudes. (you can take the girl out of california, but you can&#8217;t take california out of the girl. &#8230;hopeless one-track mind, huh?) 

p.s. please please take a moment and send me your address. really! i have plans, lovely little plans, but it requires addresses. so, [send it!][10]
