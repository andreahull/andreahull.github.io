finished: april 6, 2006  
pattern: fair isle bag designed by [beth brown-reinsel][1], kit from [nordic fiber arts][2]  
yarn: 8 balls in different colors of Rauma&#8217;s 3 tr. Strikkegarn  
needles: size 1 and 2 circs, metal addis and some clover bamboos

i *love* this bag. the pattern was easy as pie to follow and i feel much more comfortable with fair isle knitting than i did before. a fellow guild member suggested i block the heck of it, and that i did. steam blocking *with pressure* (a new technique for me) was so very fun &#8211; and it probably stretched out a good inch or more all around. this bag is definitely a bit bigger than the pattern stated, but i like that.

the yarn is really great &#8211; esepcially the brown, which was ever-so-slightly heathered, i think. there&#8217;s a *lot* of leftover yarn, so it&#8217;s going to pop up in future projects, that&#8217;s for sure. the yardage per skein is really generous and there&#8217;s such a great substantial feel to the yarn in general.

so, the bag is not *entirely* finished, as i mean to add a lining at some point &#8211; but that means sewing, something i&#8217;m not very good at nor do i like to do. but the knitting part- ahhh, lovely. anyhow, following [others&#8217;][3] example, when i was done with a color, i simply knotted it with another and snipped away &#8211; no need to worry about all those ends! once i get the lining in, you&#8217;ll never know they existed. 

also, i added a second strap, again following what [others][4] had done &#8211; and this one i saw in person at a l.a. meetup, always a bonus. 

this was my second fair isle try, thanks to [mj][5]&#8217;s [norwegian knit along][6], and i must say my interest in fair isle has not diminished. next step will be to work on my tensioning a bit, with another not-yet-decided fair isle project, and then i&#8217;m moving to big things, i.e. a sweater i&#8217;ve been dying to knit from the excellent book [*poetry in stiches*][7]. yay.

i highly highly recommend this project to anyone who wants to try more fair isle &#8211; just remember to steam block it like crazy to get rid of any irregularities in tension, it *really* does work. 

oh, that nect-to-last pic shows trouble&#8217;s favorite place to sit the last few days &#8211; why is it that cats always love being right where the action is? my first cat, pepper, when i was growing up, loved to sit right *on* my books while i was reading them. <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" />
