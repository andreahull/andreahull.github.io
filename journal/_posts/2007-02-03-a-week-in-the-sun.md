hi there ~ 

this past week i&#8217;ve been in barbados with about half of my family, soaking up the sun. today&#8217;s our last day, we leave later this afternoon, but i plan on making the best of the remaining hours in the sunshine, especially as the forecast for tuesday in maryland is snow..! one extreme to the other, i like that. love the snow, but i&#8217;d forgotten how beautiful blue waters can be. 

here&#8217;s some pics to brighten up your winter days.. i have adorable nephew and niece photos, but i often feel shy posting kid pics online, unless there&#8217;s something super special to celebrate, know what i mean? so, some landscapes, a moonscape, and me zoning out while wearing my new enormous hat.

this is our second time to the east coast of the island &#8211; the winds blow strong, the waves crash loud, the tourists are few, and the stars at night make you feel like the teeniest speck in the galaxy&#8217;s eye.
