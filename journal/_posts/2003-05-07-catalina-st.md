hello!

finally moved in a week ago (already!) & i love it. i love living by myself and my two sweet cats and having a nice clean comfy home. now i have to catch up with work at the archives and keep on crossing my fingers about ucla (yeah, they still haven&#8217;t gotten back to me :Z ) ..hopefully i&#8217;ll get a dsl line at the apartment real soon and then, man, i&#8217;ll be flying. nice maria at work gave me a php book so i&#8217;m a-studying away and hopefully that will soon be popping up here and there. my brother marcus put up [a cool new site][1]{.norm}. maybe sometime soon i&#8217;ll see my seestors here in california, whatcha think chicas? un beso a todos, 

bye, andrea
