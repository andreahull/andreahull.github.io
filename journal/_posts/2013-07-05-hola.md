2013! i remember how prince&#8217;s song &#8216;1999&#8217;, when it came out, was so exciting and new, oooh the future!, and look, here we are fourteen years beyond that. &#8230;and with that sentence i am making it clear: i&#8217;m old! well, 36 ~ and i took my time getting here, to this point in life, but for the most part i like what i have. i started this website back in 2002 and though the writing has lessened tremendously since those early heady years, i still love this little corner of the web that is mine, all mine. it&#8217;s amazing to me to go back through the years and see how much has changed and how much is exactly the same &#8211; some happily and some not. 

a little bit about me: i&#8217;m andrea hull, a 36 year old, currently living in la paz, bolivia. i moved here over three years ago with my man and a year later, almost to the day of when we had arrived, had our baby girl. she&#8217;s now an amazingly sweet and loving toddler who is the joy of our days and the twinkles in our eyes. i&#8217;m a trained librarian, with a master&#8217;s degree in library science from ucla, but haven&#8217;t worked in a library since moving here. i can&#8217;t wait to be a librarian again ~ and i&#8217;m sure i will be one again soon! i&#8217;m originally from maryland, went to undergraduate school in philadelphia (go bryn mawr!), and lived in l.a. for almost seven years. i miss the u.s. a lot but we really love bolivia and plan to stay here a long time. i love to read, write, cook, garden, & just generally make things with my hands, including knitting, spinning, papermaking, bookbinding, sewing, dyeing, and more. i love to learn, and to teach myself stuff. (in fact, that&#8217;s how i started this website, just wanting to learn html back in 2002 ~ and as a result, got several jobs as webmaster for various organizations over the years, hooray.) i&#8217;m also very interested in midwifery, natural birth, attachment parenting ideas, un-schooling, permaculture, politics generally, & oh i&#8217;m probably forgetting another dozen things or so.

you&#8217;ll find i rarely write about my family. i used to write a little more, but then my dad died of brain cancer after a horrible pain-filled ten months, and since then, i&#8217;ve gotten a bit more private. add in the fact that though i chose years ago to start this public space and record bits and pieces of my life, those around me didn&#8217;t necessarily. i&#8217;m thinking especially of my two-year old who will one day grow up and maybe not want her life plastered online before she even knew what an internet was. with that said i&#8217;m not judging others, but for me, this feels right, however adorable she is, and the other members of my family that i love so that i would love to show off to the world. ah well. <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" />
