<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="675" /></span>i&#8217;m trying to get back into the groove of posting more than once a week &#8211; especially about [things][1] [that][2] [make me mad][3] &#8211; but the week just flew by, i guess. not in a terribly good way, but that&#8217;s ok &#8211; my apartment is very very clean (considering i have two very sheddy cats) and at night i&#8217;m starting to dream of twisted stitches, cabling, and other fun knitting stuff. ha. 

but yes, it&#8217;s friday &#8211; and i have happy knitting news. inspired by laura (of [comsicpluto][4]) , i&#8217;ve finally started [mon petit chou][5], that lacy lingerie pattern from last summer&#8217;s knitty. here&#8217;s the front &#8211; and i&#8217;ll get the back done this weekend, and then the top done next week. it took a little while for me to get the pattern memorized &#8211; it&#8217;s hard being an ambidexturous [combination][6] [knitter][7] (doesn&#8217;t that sound fancy), because i have to reverse all the wrong side instructions and the increases and decreases have to be really understood structurally, i.e. are they left leaning, right leaning, or what. 

anyhow, i&#8217;m really enjoying this pattern &#8211; yes, [kate gilbert][8] creates beautiful things! &#8211; but one complaint: why isn&#8217;t there a &$*(@^ chart?! or, at the very least, a stitch count at the end of every row? in my life, i try to use as little math as possible, and yes in knitting, i&#8217;m betrayed time and time again, sigh. see the pencil, see the scribblings? that&#8217;s the mark of one frustrated andrea who wasn&#8217;t able to concentrate on her movie and instead had to fiddle with numbers. one upside: once i figured it out, i felt like a math genius.

i&#8217;m loving the picot hem &#8211; i&#8217;ve never done one of those things before and it&#8217;s really fun to do, plus to begin i had to cast-on invisibly (sounds funny that way, doesn&#8217;t it), which i had never successfully done. i love the color &#8211; and so far, it seems like i&#8217;ll only need one ball of cascade&#8217;s fixation to finish it up, yay. 

for knitting inspiration, and a peek at where i&#8217;m heading, see here: [only two balls of jaeger trinity to make this corset!][9], and [can&#8217;t help it, i love this shrug][10], and yikes, it&#8217;s almost the end of september, and i have yet to finish my [stitch ya neck out][11] turtleneck shrug, i.e. dpns, here i come.

lastly, i&#8217;ve found out over the last few weeks that various people i had no idea knew of this site are reading it &#8211; makes me a tad nervous, but ultimately, welcoming. <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> so, welcome luci and claud&#8217;s [raleigh addidas][12] folks! 

have a great weekend everyone.

update: bloglines is ignoring me and i&#8217;m not happy about that.
