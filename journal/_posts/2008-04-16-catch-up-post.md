<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="1296" /></span>you know it&#8217;s been too long since you&#8217;ve written when your browser no longer has your url cached. it&#8217;s only been a little over a month, i realized, but my, what a month. still, this post, i decided, is going to be cancer-free. i was going to title it that, in fact, but i thought that a) my humor has gotten a little twisted and b) doing that would kind of defeat the purpose exactly. ha. instead, how about fiber, fiber, some random stuff, and then a bit of family.

first off, this is going to be a busy couple of weeks coming up. why? oh, just [yarn school][1] (!). and then a [fiber preparation][2] workshop (!). and then, but of course, [maryland sheep & wool][3] in all its lovely sheepiness. (!!) i will be on fiber *overload* but i don&#8217;t care. <span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="1297" /></span>fiber or bust, that&#8217;s the way i see it. plus i&#8217;m the class aide for the workshop (which means i get the class 1/2 off, yay), and i&#8217;m helping out at the fleece show too. yikes.

next, who decided they needed a portable wheel for all this traveling? yes, yes, that would be andrea. a pretty [victoria][4] came home with me, after visiting [misty mountain farm][5] in nearby virgina. i tell ya, when i treat myself, i treat myself *good*. i don&#8217;t usually go this all out, but i&#8217;m in a serious fuckit mood. or i was &#8211; i&#8217;m restraining myself ever-so-slightly right now. we&#8217;ll see how early may goes. <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" />

in other news, i&#8217;ve processed one whole fleece, my first. <span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="1298" /></span>you may remember, i got three last year &#8211; one is done. the smallest one. ahem. but still, a lot was learned and whew, it will hold me back from getting too many this year. i&#8217;m aiming for one or two more at most. and also, i&#8217;ve learned that no matter how cheap or cheaper a fleece is, more than just a *little* of vm isn&#8217;t worth the work at all. valuable lesson, that. 

also, looking forward to the fibery loveliness coming up, i&#8217;ve spun up all but two pounds of roving and the two fleeces. that&#8217;s it &#8211; that&#8217;s the stash that&#8217;s left.* all the rest, three or four pounds in total, has been spun since early february. that&#8217;s a lot of spinning there &#8211; including four ounces of cotton, which may not sound like a lot, <span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="1299" /></span>but is a *lot* of work for a newbie like me. my spinning is still very beginnerish, but i&#8217;m very happy with the progress made in the last year or so and really, it&#8217;s been an amazing escape for me. 

(*oh. except for a teeny fleece that came home with my victoria. some gorgeous finn that was calling, calling!, to me. practically no vm, barely any second cuts, generously priced and well skirted. plus i got to pet some brand-new lambs just a minute earlier &#8211; how can a girl say no? i sorted through three of the seven pounds already, and have washed 8 ounces. lovely lovely. pics to come. )

so yeah. <span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="1300" /></span>lots of good fiber stuff there. in other news, my gardening plans are going ahead, finally, for once in my life &#8211; my dad has a gorgeous orchard in the back that&#8217;s been neglected for a couple of years, so i&#8217;ve been learning how to prune (!) and reading up on raised bed gardening. i tried growing some plants from seed, but so far, it&#8217;s looking a little depressing, sigh. nevertheless, very very interesting. also, i&#8217;ve been on an organizational kick in my room &#8211; jewelry, books, clothing, furniture, you name it. also destashing and tossing and donating stuff left and right. decluttering one&#8217;s life feels delicious, but is a loooong process. 

then, family stuff (sorry for the list-like writing, but if i didn&#8217;t post *something* soon, i&#8217;d have no idea how to start again):<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="1301" /></span> a cousin is engaged i hear (congrats, kenneth!), three others are pregnant (sylvana, kiki, and karen!), and my littlest sister, lucinda, got engaged (you&#8217;re a lucky man, andy!). so, lot&#8217;s of exclamation marks all around. i love my family.

there you have it, all caught up. hope each and every one of you are doing well. sorry for the disappearing act, i&#8217;ll try to stick around a little more. happy wednesday ~ ~
