i&#8217;ve come to one, hopefully a big one, at least in regards to this site here: for lack of a better term, being a comment whore is .. well, silly. 

what&#8217;s a comment whore? simple to determine: if you say yes to two or more of the criteria below, you&#8217;re one too.

~ you don&#8217;t post more than once or twice a week in hopes of gettting more comments  
~ you find yourself muttering/praying/squealing &#8220;double digits! double digits!&#8221;  
~ even though you have a long list of daydream posts (to be defined later if necessary), you still don&#8217;t post in hopes of accruing comments on current post  
~ you look at your log/flappr/bloglines number a lot  
~ you ungraciously feel maligned by those who you *know* are reading but still do not comment (edited to add: i *so* don&#8217;t mean this as a complaint! shoot, i don&#8217;t comment all the time on other&#8217;s writings, and i totally don&#8217;t expect others to either. rather, it&#8217;s an example of my comment-obsesssion. funny, right? ha ha? hm.)

yes, i&#8217;ve been guilty of them all. i blame it on a un-commented youth blog-wise. bring out the violins, i know, but really! i didn&#8217;t get any comments for a long time (months and months) from anyone when i first started this out (except for [amanda][1], who will always have a special place in my heart as a result <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> ) so now, my appetite is just voracious.

but. revelation, right? right. so, yup, it&#8217;s all silly. there&#8217;s toooo many posts i have already *written out*, in my head at least, practiced in my car a dozen times, but i just haven&#8217;t posted them. 

therefore, i&#8217;m determined to break this pattern, starting now with a short video i made a whiiiiile back, enjoy! 

caveat: having recognized it as silly does not mean i won&#8217;t fall off the wagon every once in a while, but know that as i do, at least i&#8217;ll recognize it as such <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" />

(the film bit takes about 30 &#8211; 40 seconds to load, give it time, ok? and yeah, i know i twist my mouth and crinkle my face a lot when i talk, what can i say.)

(also (can you tell i&#8217;m a bit nervous about posting this? <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> ), the weird pauses by me in the beginning were due to sounds of fighting i could hear from my window, sounds i hear way too often sadly. for info&#8217;s sake, especially regarding hair!, this video was taken in late september. )
