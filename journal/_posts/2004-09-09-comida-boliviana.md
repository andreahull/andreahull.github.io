mmmm, some of my favorite bolivian food. here&#8217;s some recipes i&#8217;ve collected, mostly from the cookbook &#8216;epicuro andino&#8217;..

  * &#187; [humintas][1]: i&#8217;ve made these before, they&#8217;re really good and not too sweet, unlike many desserts..
  * &#187; silpancho: hands down, one of the best meals in the world
  * &#187; [papas a la huancaina][2]
  * &#187; [llauchas][3]
  * &#187; pazancaya: like kettle corn, but so much better!
  * &#187; salte&#241;as

also, here&#8217;s a list of [some local bolivian vegetables][4]
