<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="1055" /></span>hi there ~ 

from [that long list][1], i ended up doing three of the projects this week, along with two other mini-projects not listed *and* i finally re-organized my room. 

i&#8217;ve lived here now for two and a half months and i guess i hadn&#8217;t really stopped and realized how uncomfortable i was in my own room. it&#8217;s a great space &#8211; a downstairs area (with my table and bookcases you&#8217;ve seen in other pictures), steep stairs, and a loft area that holds my bed &#8211; but it just didn&#8217;t feel right. maybe the andrea of ten years ago &#8211; <span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="1056" /></span> the last time i lived in this room &#8211; but definitely not the andrea of today. anyhow, with an unexpected burst of energy (and you *know* you have to take advantage of those), all saturday and most of sunday, i cleaned and moved and tossed and hammered and unpacked (still!). after the dust had settled, what was left was a room i have since woken up to with a smile. pretty pics another day, when the sun decides to grace us with its presence. <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> 

i pride myself on being able to create for myself a *home* but i&#8217;d not done that here until just a few days ago. yes, it&#8217;s my parents&#8217; home, but i also needed to make it *my* home, ..or at least my room.<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="1054" /></span> maybe i wasn&#8217;t ready to before, but wow does it feel better now. don&#8217;t think i&#8217;m not still missing you, l.a.! .. but it&#8217;s good to feel homey again.

so. on to the projects. first off, i swatched twice for the poetry in stitches sweater &#8211; which absolutely needs a name.. any suggestions? Most Beautiful is one i was thinking of <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> &#8211; and realized sadly that size 3 needles, and not the suggested 4, work best. not much of a difference, i know, but oh in my mind..! still, i&#8217;m always fascinated by picot edgings &#8211; such a simple thing to do but it&#8217;s just a genius idea. it&#8217;s amazing what a fold can do. 

<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="1057" /></span>then, i finished the main pattern for the vogue turkish cape, including the short rows and, ta-da!, my first buttonhole. now, i need to pick up almost 300 stitches (!) and knit the border pattern plus some facing. i&#8217;m definitely seeing some tension issues in the super-intricate part, so i&#8217;ve decided partly to just let it go (hooray) and partially that i will block, block, and block again. so far, i&#8217;ve done one block and already it looks loads better. also!: the last three repeats were all done two-handed! before i would knit with one color, drop it, pick up the next color, knit with that, drop it, etc. now, instead, i&#8217;m dipping with one finger, then the other, back and forth &#8211; much much faster. 

and finally, a little mini-project i&#8217;ve been meaning to do for months. a while back, while still in l.a., i bought a [jill bliss mobile kit][2] (remember that, [rose][3]?) &#8211; the theme was &#8220;under sea&#8221; and it was a collaboration between bliss and salee, another artist. anyhow, armed with scissors, a few branches from the back yard, a variety of string, and a hole punch, i made my own mobile. fancy. love it.  
however, a word of warning: the shy mobile is incredibly difficult to capture on film! it is best observed in the wild, err, my room.

hope your (long) weekend was excellent ~ ~

p.s. much of this work was all done listening to a variety of music (that [geico commercial][4] put roykspopp&#8217;s &#8220;remind me&#8221; in my head all saturday), movies ( *walk the line* and *aguirre, wrath of god* &#8211; re-peats but so good), and [a ton][5] [of audio][6] [and video][7] [interviews][8]. 

p.s. again. i only showed two of the projects from that list. any guess on the third? it&#8217;s a doozy, lemme tell you.
