hello! i&#8217;m in a cheery chirpy mood this morning, even though i have a teeny bit of work to do still for school that will officially be late in about an hour. *but* it&#8217;s a beautiful day, i&#8217;m going to drive up to palo alto this weekend and hang out with one of my sisters, i got a new (well, new for me) computer at work, the sun is shining beautifully, a lotta rain is on the way (i love rain! especially now that my car window is fixed..), and more. <span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="184" /></span>

plus.. what is this? knitting?! yes, yes, starteritis is over! i&#8217;m very excited about this beautiful project so far. it&#8217;s a pattern i found procrastinating the other night called [lelah][1] &#8211; it&#8217;s so pretty isn&#8217;t it? i happened to have two skeins of bernat&#8217;s super-soft cotton tots in white lying around and i wondered if it would be enough. happily, it looks like it will be &#8211; what you see in the picture is just barely over one skein used and i&#8217;m in the homestretch, with just about three or four inches of stockinette to go. 

there&#8217;s a bit of post-knitting-work to do, including sewing in some elastic for the top, blocking it like crazy, and, i&#8217;m thinking, making an elegant little i-cord tie for the middle as well as possibly (i&#8217;m getting ambitious here) some attachable ties for added security/support/style when i&#8217;m wanting it. we&#8217;ll see about those i-cord additions, but i&#8217;m feeling so happy with this whole thing, i might just very well do it. <span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="185" /></span>

this last pic just makes me happy &#8211; my mom got me these really cute ice cube tray, and in some weird spurt of spring-antsy energy, i&#8217;ve been smoothe-ing like crazy. a little ice cube heart slowly melting in my smoothie has been making me laugh and smile for days now. 

yesterday was &#8216;world water day&#8217;. though that might seem a bit silly to some, it&#8217;s not. many people are more and more [talking about][2] how water will be, or is, the oil of the 21st century. in bolivia, for example. there&#8217;s been [so much][3] [struggle][4] over attempts at privatizing the water and all over the world, access to drinkable (potable is such a weird word) water is [a serious serious issue][5]. (over a billion peple lack access to safe drinking water &#8211; what a scary fact. &#8216;water, water everywhere and not a drop to drink&#8217;, right? shudder.) a new documentary i want to see called [thirst][6] talks about some of these issues, and so does [this one][7]&#8230; basically it all comes down to the idea of whether or not water is a human right. damn right it is, i say. (i say it chirply, btw &#8211; my mood remains up up up!)
