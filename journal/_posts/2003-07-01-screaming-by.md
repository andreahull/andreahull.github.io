hello!

first of july and the year is just screaming by (i&#8217;m a poet didn&#8217;t know it my feet showed it they&#8217;re longfellows). i&#8217;m getting pretty sick of this whole full time job thing and am a little worried about the fall with ucla and a full time job but i know it will be great. am missing my family a lot&#8212;thank goodness i have vacya and my sweet kittens here in la-la-land to remind me i am loved alot here too. found out i was categorized as a nonresident for [ucla][1]{.norm} which means more money so argh i gotta fight that and i have yet to get dsl (a month after ordering it argh) and my car has yet to be alarmed. i just re-read anne mccaffrey&#8217;s decision at doona and loved it and am now reading neil gaiman&#8217;s stardust which is good, though i don&#8217;t like his sandman stuff that much. i&#8217;m in bad with the [la public library][2]{.norm} and if i could just buy a bike then i could drop off my books real easy like. a beachcruiser with a basket in the front. i need to get a computer too, for the fall, and i&#8217;ve decided on a notebook but what kind i&#8217;m not sure. 

bye, andrea
