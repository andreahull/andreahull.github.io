<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="102" /></span>happy friday ~ i hope everyone is as excited about this weekend as i am&#8212;- and what do i have planned that is so exciting? nothing. yup, nothing nada zilch. there&#8217;s lot of things i *should* do, but there&#8217;s a mile-wide chasm between should and must. phew.

like so many out there, i&#8217;m trying to not slow down but literally cut off my horrible spending habit in regards to knitting. i was doing good for a while and then i decided that buying patterns, magazines, [books][1], needles and other non-use-up-able things were really *investments* and thus could not in the least bit be considered &#8216;shopping&#8217;. well, i&#8217;ve nipped that bad idea in the, well, not the bud, but at least mid-bloom. (in defense: the defuzzer to the right i bought weeks ago but only days ago bought the required batteries.)

my topsecret sweater is inching along &#8211; i don&#8217;t like the yarn (bernat&#8217;s illusions) one bit, and my fingers are unhappy. ah well, my illuisions have been shattered. (such a dork, i know.)

<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="106" /></span>i love my new defuzzer &#8211; cheap and so fun to use. this is what it took off my [felted tab bag][2] i made in august that already had a ton of fuzzies on them.

also, last week i [mentioned][3] laundry and sweeping/mopping my place. well, the great thing about a world-class procrastinator is that i&#8217;ve built up so much stuff i have to do that when my procrastination-bug kicks in, i procrastinate from doing the things i should be doing (i.e. laundry) by doing other things i should&#8217;ve done months and months ago (i.e. finally organizing my bills and school papers). so, yup, this weekend i *still* have a ton of laundry to do (in the last pic you can see trouble daring me to move her from my laundry pile) and floors to clean. *or* there&#8217;s that dirty tub that could use some scrubbing&#8230;

lastly, i&#8217;ve given up on the whole idea of keeping my [bloglines subscriptions][4] to equal my age &#8211; for those of you that had already predicted that, kindly keep your gloating to yourselves.

p.s. check out my new re-design for ucla&#8217;s [saa chapter][5] &#8211; just went live this morning.
