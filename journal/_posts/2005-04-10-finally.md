my website and email and *life* is back up. seriously, deprived since friday&#8212;which feels like *so* long ago&#8212;of no email or website was driving me nutso. it was a little scary in fact how much a difference it made to *not* have these things&#8230; !

<strike>i&#8217;m still having problems with my email&#8212;if you want, or just really *need* to reach me ;), leave a comment here and i&#8217;ll get back to you using another email account..</strike>&#8212;all set and back to normal. if these pages look funny or load weirdly, please tell me!

anyhow, with that done i feel calmer now and off i go to buy a dress for the upcoming wedding&#8212;etiquette is a bit of question here. what kind of dresses are appropriate: short? sleeveless? black? white? you get the idea. the only info i have is it&#8217;s a wedding in the evening (6 pm) and will be officiated in the cathedral in palermo. so.. off to shop i go. 

it&#8217;s a happy day today in so many ways &#8211; and the future is looking good.
