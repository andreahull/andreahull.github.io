<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="250" /></span>hello internet! i&#8217;ve been a busy bee, yes i have thank goodness, and so far have been able to pretty much keep on top of school work and work work and even a little (but really such a small little) bit of house work&#8230; just as i&#8217;m typing though, i see one of my plants &#8211; a hardy succulant jade plant no less! &#8211; is visibly dying so all&#8217;s not totally well in this here hull household (alliteration! and yes that&#8217;s my last name by the way <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> ) plus i&#8217;m wearing bottom-of-the-barrel clothing and my cats are playing hide-and-seek in the laundry <strike>basket</strike> mountain, so ahem, yes there&#8217;s still quite a bit to do. however, on to the knitting, right? <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> 

as you can see, [the lacy bonnet][1] has sprouted i-cords. a somewhat mismatched (that is, non-lacey) pair of mittens are being sent too &#8211; my sweet niece kiyra has a bad habit of ripping her hair out (what is *that* about?) so these fancy mittens will come in handy in the church, i&#8217;m thinking &#8211; i mean, what would it mean it she was being baptised and she started tearing her hair out! that would have to be a pretty bad omen, huh ..hee.

<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="248" /></span>and what is this? a long-lost package finally arrived (postman = grrrrrr) from my now-not-so-secret pal [kimberli][2]! 5 gorgeous balls of pingouin&#8217;s asadir &#8211; they&#8217;re so airy and squishy, i love love them! and of course i immediately cast-on for this great plassard tank &#8216;ella&#8217;. i figure if i&#8217;m going to give cables a try, why just stick with one boring cable and instead how about go crrrazy trying to do several at one go? fraidy-cat that i am, i started with the back and finished it last night, simple ribbing. this was the first time i&#8217;d tried provisional casting-on, invisible casting-on, or whatever you call it &#8211; plassard&#8217;s great english translation called it &#8216;extensible casting -on&#8217;. anyhow, the yarn is a dream to knit &#8211; and it&#8217;s a cotton blend so it&#8217;ll be so cool to wear in the l.a. summer heat. i can&#8217;t wait &#8211; thank you so much [kimberli][2]! 

<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="247" /></span>also, sometime last week i started knitty&#8217;s [itsybity mesh bag][3] &#8211; i&#8217;m up to the sides part and it&#8217;s really slow going, especially since i decided to make it a bit wider than called for. but it was fun doing new stitches &#8211; herringbone, mesh, and basketweave &#8211; as well as doing a crochet cast-on, a good warm up to the invisible cast-on for my tank.

lastly, i met up with [winnie][4] last weekend and it went great. two yarn stores were closed (sux!), and though the other one was open, we didn&#8217;t get anything &#8211; how very unfulfilling. but then we went over to her place and <strike>drooled</strike> looked over my phildar mags and decided to do our own duo-knitalong! it&#8217;s going to be so great &#8211; phildar patterns are challenging and so those times when i&#8217;m eeking to myself silently, i can now eek away to winnie. i ordered the yarn yesterday from knitpicks (finally!) but with no guilt since the yarn is so darn cheap *and* since a specific project is in mind. of course, i threw in a denise needle set while i was at it. yay!
