<span class="swf"><txp:kml_flashembed movie="http://mellowtrouble.net/etc/yulelog.swf" height="100%" width="100%" /></span>hello! i arrived in maryland a few days ago and it&#8217;s just been a whirlwind: my nieces are enormous! my feet are killing me. i&#8217;m a knitting fiend. i have *no* wrapping paper. i&#8217;m entirely foregoing any watching-what-i-eat thoughts. it&#8217;s all so great. 

i&#8217;ll be on the east coast till the 4th and will definitely post more after christmas. besides maryland, i&#8217;ll also be visiting my little sisters&#8217; new home in north carolina and then i&#8217;m going on a four day cruise with my parents and younger sisters for the new year. wow, it&#8217;s going to be verrry fun.

i hope you have a chance to sit around a warm fireplace.. that and the smell of pine is what makes winter winter.

feeling decidedly happy, and hoping you are too ~
