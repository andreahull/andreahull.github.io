happy friday! as always, so glad to see the weekend. so glad it&#8217;s a little ridiculous.

i wrote about some web color tools earlier, but here&#8217;s some more to add to the list: [color.twysted.net][1] is bee-you-tee-ful! and this [color palette][2] will be mighty useful. was is it about color guides and tools that soothe and please me so much? something to do with reviving often-flagging enthusiasm over my site. everything feels all brand new. silly me. [mezzoblue][3] linked to this good article from [boxesandarrows][4] on [selecting colors found in nature][5]

where libraries and web design meet: [a section of the <acronym title="library of congress">loc</acronym> online][6] has just been redesigned and looks pretty shnazzy, besides being xhtml 1.0 transitional valid **and**, if you have an old browser, they have a link directing the user to [webstandards.org][7]! hip hip hooray! (it&#8217;s a shame the linked page has to have all that distracting text at the top about spam alerts and all that.) now, if only they could get [the main loc page][8] to look a little less stodgy..  
<acronym title="information architecture">ia</acronym> happiness is [this new findability][9] site. i&#8217;m very happy to note that on the [libraries & literacy][10] section, it says &#8220;the ultimate search engine is a reference librarian.&#8221; yup, that is correct.

i never head about [this cluetrain thing][11] and i don&#8217;t have time right now to read all ninety-five declarations but a few things: i don&#8217;t like how the ideas are all distanced from each other and numbered, makes it seem more pretentious; all of it reminds me of a kind of annoying the-whole-world-has-changed! tech rant that i remember reading about before the whole dotcom burst; good ideas but still seeming like a corporate marketing plan; and, of the ones i read, i like #7 best: &#8216;hyperlinks subvert hierarchy.&#8217; i think i&#8217;m years late in talking about this thing, but better late than never, huh.  
[willful infringemnet][12] is a new film about one man&#8217;s fight with disney over <acronym title="intellectual property">ip</acronym>. [this article][13] talks a bit about the film, which includes commentary by (my favorite) carrie mclaren from [stay free magazine][14], negativland, and more. maybe i can get [vidiots][15] to get it..

i&#8217;d been dreading yesterday all week long and now it&#8217;s over, thank goodness. it went well, actually. it was just looong. last night i went to bed pretty happy knowing thursday was over. i have much to fix, but for now at least, the overwhelimg sense of instability has lessened incredibly. cross your fingers for me..
