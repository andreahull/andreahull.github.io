      an excellent excellent book. this book won the printz award, the highest award a YA (young adult) book can win &#8211; and i&#8217;m so glad it got the praise it deserves. such an original book &#8211; though i understand where some of the criticisms coming from regarding the narrator&#8217;s voice, it <em>was</em> a little disconcerting initially. soon enough though, i settled into it and was very happy to do so.

      for a while now, iâ€™ve been meaning to create a page of books from two of my favorite genres: dystopias and post-apocalyptic lit. donâ€™t know why theyâ€™re my two favs, but they have been for years and years. classics like neil shuteâ€™s â€œon the beachâ€? cemented it, but surprisingly thereâ€™s a whole lot of YA and kidâ€™s books out there that fit the bill as well. anyhow, â€œhow i live nowâ€? was really really good â€“ highly recommended
