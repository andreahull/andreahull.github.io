<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="1002" /></span>my schedule seems to be settling down a bit &#8211; i tend to spend every other day with my sister, and i like to do it in one go, i.e. the whole day, and on those odd days, i have time to spend with my brother, my mom, and time just for me. last night was a combo of the last two &#8211; the early evening was spent organizing all my fiber, hence that first pic. (btw, the desk is an old one of my dad&#8217;s &#8211; he had it forever in his study and i love it. it&#8217;s a little too shiny for photos, but it&#8217;s a nice long and wide desk.) ideally, i want to exchange the plastic for some nice wood bins, but for now, i&#8217;m happy with this setup. not included is the one (small) rubbermaid container that holds all my fiber &#8211; maybe three pounds max, which surprised me.

<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="1004" /></span> my mom came back later that night and we ended up chatting and gossiping, and then a bit later, i convinced her (it wasn&#8217;t that hard <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> ) to give a try at the wheel &#8211; look how cute she is! (and see how the cats have gotten used to her. awesome.) and such a perfectionist &#8211; she kept saying that the yarn wasn&#8217;t right, that she wouldn&#8217;t be able to do anything with it, and so on. anyhow, it was a good time, and i got some spinning in myself &#8211; first clearing off all the bobbins (hence the three little skeins of singles) and then finishing up the merino/silk noil 2-ply, which came out super-consistent, hooray. 

today i&#8217;m off to the mall with my brother-in-law and the three eldest kids, to give my sister some alone time with her newborn. my dad gets back from bolivia tonight, so i&#8217;ll probably go to the airport to pick him up. what else.. oh! i **have** to get a scratching pad for my cats, as their carpet-tree-thing isn&#8217;t cutting it. busy day, but first, a late breakfast. happy sunday ~ ~<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="1003" /></span>

and a few links:

~ have you heard about [the yarn museum][1]?   
~ [browsershots][2] is like [browser cam][3] but it&#8217;s free. see what your site looks like in different browsers on different operating systems. handy.  
~ download youtube videos to your computer! for my mac, i use a combo of [this greasemonkey script][4] and [isquint][5], making it literally a two-step process. easy!  
~ [stamp carving 101][6]. a bunch of years back, i was into making stamps and i keep meaning to make some more. hm. 

<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="1005" /></span>p.s. re: that last pic &#8211; i finally finished the laceleaf sweater! after almost a year of just laying at the bottom of the <acronym title="works-in-progress">wips</acronym> basket, it took about thirty minutes to finish. now if only i can find the intended button, it&#8217;s around here somewhere. after that, a good steam and i&#8217;ll be ready to show some pics.

it&#8217;s cold enough here, that&#8217;s for sure, brrr. 

p.s. again: a more formal write-up soon, but for now, check out, and sign up for!, [the stranded colorwork knitalong][7] that [mj][8], [mary-heather][9] and i are hosting. hooray for color <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" />
