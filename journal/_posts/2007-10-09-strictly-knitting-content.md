it&#8217;s knit out of some yarn i bought way back when i first started knitting, not realizing (and not told by the destasher, ahem) that it was rug yarn and therefore incredibly scratchy. but i&#8217;ve decided i&#8217;ll just wear it on the days i don&#8217;t feel like being hugged. it&#8217;ll be my first defense. 

hope your tuesday is a happy & relaxed one ~
