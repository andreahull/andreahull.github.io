(*ominous title, but i mean it literally. and it thrills me, of course. yay rain.)

what&#8217;s become normal now is for me to think, &#8220;oh but poppy is..&#8221; and then my brain just skips. stops right there and literally, a little hop and i move on. and that feels right and necessary. but then other times, it&#8217;s the opposite &#8211; it&#8217;s almost like an indulgence, a pleasure, to force myself to think that he is gone. it&#8217;s like i know it will cause pain, but i kinda need that pain, because at least that will stop me from feeling, for a bit at least, this frustrating anxious explosive feeling that keeps building up in me each day, that makes me become a leg shaker while sitting, a tight-mouthed and perpetually clenched body andrea. 

still, compared to the last ten months, this past almost-month has been good. good! can you believe that. there&#8217;s been more crying and face-crumpling then almost at any point in my life, but still it&#8217;s been good. i think a crucial part of that has been the brain skips. i keep expecting my dad to walk in, like normal, and then stop in his tracks and say, &#8216;whaaat? i&#8217;m dead?! uhh, i don&#8217;t think so!&#8221; another crucial part has been the babies &#8211; can i just say again how much i love being an aunt? they and the cats have saved me countless times from just drowning in the sadness of minutes passing.

it&#8217;s just a mix of ups and downs. it really is. and i&#8217;m not trying to make sense of it all (though i am organizing my thoughts a tad with this post). and partially that&#8217;s because underneath, and not even that far under, i&#8217;m really really angry. that also explodes out at random moments, and has forced me to breathe deeply and concentrate whenever i get in a car, in fear that a stupid driver will provide some easy channel for my rage. 

but with all that said, today i&#8217;m happy. it&#8217;s amazing how the body and brain and heart and all that can hold so many things, so many feelings. but this is the best part: i love. i&#8217;m loved.

sorry, still puttering around on this here website. but i had to write this. ~ thanks for all your sweet email and comments. it really helped me, you all are good friends.
