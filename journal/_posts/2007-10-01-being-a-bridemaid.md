<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="1224" /></span>&#8230;requires some work even before the wedding, particularly if it&#8217;s your sister that&#8217;s getting hitched. so, we&#8217;ve been doing some letterpressing and yay, it&#8217;s going great. this is claudin&#8217;s first time setting type and my third time on a [vandercook][1] (which is the type of press we used, different from the typical [clamshell/platen ][2] types of press), so it&#8217;s been a bit blind-leading-the-blind, but we&#8217;ve managed pretty well, i think. plus, great music and happy chatter keep things moving. 

tomorrow we go back to the presses one last time, then we have to assemble all the invitations<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="1225" /></span>, stuff the envelopes, and i get to label them all, as my handwriting was deemed the least worst. <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> still, i labeled my older sister&#8217;s wedding invitations, so it&#8217;s becoming kind of tradition-ish and i like that. happily, it&#8217;s going to be a small wedding, so that&#8217;s not too many invitations, but it&#8217;s still a bunch of work. we&#8217;ll have them all in the mail october 2nd, appropriately the bride-to-be&#8217;s 26th birthday. 

in other news, the knitting keeps on coming. i finished another quick handspun knit, i got a package of yarn today (elann has *the* fastest shipping hands-down) for a new project, and i now have *four* finished knits that need photographing, yikes. really, it&#8217;s kind of exciting since i&#8217;d been in such a knitting slump for months and months. 

which leads me to: this [ravelry][3] thing is so addicting. i know that&#8217;s not much news to other knitting fiends, but i keep being surprised. <span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="1226" /></span>i just love feeling so fiber-organized and having everything all visually displayed and lined up. really, it&#8217;s endlessly entertaining. a tad distressing in how much *time* it occupies, but for now, with the hint of fall in the air, it&#8217;s *perfect*.

ok, so g&#8217;night & happy october (can you believe it?? sheesh) ~ ~
