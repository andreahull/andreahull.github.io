<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="327" /></span>hello ~ i can&#8217;t believe the weekend is over, grrrrroan. i spent large amounts of the past week, particularly this weekend, working on some nasty stuff that i&#8217;ll probably post about later, but let me just say for now it involves my car and insurance companies. thank goodness other things happened that were quite nice &#8211; such as.. tadaa! orangina is done.

thanks so much to all of you who answered [my poll][1] the other day &#8211; part of me was very tempted to gift away and/or frog whilst weeping, but i stuck with the winning answer of washy washy washy. and it worked. phew. 

this *was* an easy knit, and i love love lace, but the size problems just proved to me (again! ..wonder if i&#8217;ll learn this time!) <span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="330" /></span>that i really have to be more careful and spend more time in planning a project. i need to learn to love words like &#8216;gauge&#8217; and &#8216;swatch&#8217; and shoot, even &#8216;measure&#8217;. so, yup, i finished knitting this in june, but didn&#8217;t have it really done done until august. man, that&#8217;s pretty bad. anyhow, more info on the pattern is on [the project page][2] &#8211; including some upclose pics of the shoulder seaming that some people had asked about. 

and the other pic you see here? yup, my obligatory farmer&#8217;s market haul shot. what you see there is $20 worth of food, with the honey and eggs making up $5. not only is all of this locally grown, but for the most part, it&#8217;s organic and, in the case of the eggs, cage-free. i&#8217;m not doing terribly well on [the goal][3] of half of my meals being locally produced, i&#8217;m probably more around 25% right now. but my pantry and fridge are almost completely cleaned out, <span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="323" /></span>and i see a delicious meal in my future &#8211; i mean, tonight. yup, corn on the cob, roasted potatoes, carrot salad, steamed green beans, and more. &#8216;goody&#8217; is not a word i like to use loosely, but here it really does apply. <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" />

a few weeks ago, i finally sent off my [backtack][4] stuff &#8211; yup, weeks and weeks late, but kristin of [spinning athena][5] was so sweet and cool about it, thank goodness. and happily she seems to love [what i ultimately sent][6], yay. 

and lastly, if you haven&#8217;t seen them yet &#8211; the new [phildar tendances mag][7] is lovely lovely, and all kinds of [other knitting previews][8] are up too. and some [knitty][9] [surprises][10]
