title: a knitting question    
layout: post

i just picked up a ton of stitches to start the skirt section for the [tilted duster][1], from the latest IK, and though i picked up the amount specified, i have a theoretical question: 

if you cast on x amount of stitches, then isn&#8217;t x the maximum you can pick up from that cast-on edge without making the resulting knitted fabric pucker?

that&#8217;s what i understood, and yet here, we pick up 40 stitches, for example, from the 36-stitch cast-on edge of the left front (+2 stitches for selvedge that i almost always tack on). i assume [nora gaughan][2] knows better than i &#8211; and no one else knitting the duster has even peeped about it online &#8211; but i&#8217;m still a tad confused. what am i not understanding?

thanks ~ and btw, [columbus sucks][3].
