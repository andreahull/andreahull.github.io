hi ~

running out the door to go see [good bye lenin!][1] since i bought a pack of movie passes months ago and they&#8217;re due to expire in three days.. vacya says it is condoleezza rice&#8217;s favorite movie. also, he calls me a bushie for thinking the movie looks good. with no school or work today, it&#8217;s matinee time, yay!

we *did* go hiking on saturday &#8211; for five hours! which was quite! a shock to our sedentary bodies, and so sunday we were both staggering around like drunks. ok, i&#8217;ll write more later, for now here&#8217;s [a link][2] to the pictures we took while hiking around..

almost midnight. goodbye lenin! was really good. last night and the night before i saw two good documentaries: [etoiles: dancers of the paris opera ballet][3] and [hell house][4]. etoiles was very pretty, as suspected, but hell house was better, i think. i never had heard about hell houses before but, to sum up, they&#8217;re basically christian-themed haunted houses. put up around halloween-time, they depict all kinds of modern horrors, like the columbine shootings, rape, murder, suicide, domestic violence. and no hell house is complete without an abortion scence and a gay-person-dying-of-aids scene. the idea is to scare people into converting/being born again. scary indeed.

i read a lot in the last few days, but still for the whole month of march, outside of school-reading, i only read [four books][5]. that might be a clue to my current (and really for the past two weeks or so) extreme moodiness and jitteriness. hopefully april will be a better book month.

i received the <acronym title="american library association">ala</acronym> catalog today, which included all kinds of &#8220;read at your library&#8221; posters featuring celebrities holding a book ostensibly &#8216;caught&#8217; reading. it was funny to see who was reading what. [tim robbins][6] was reading [howard zinn][7]&#8217;s [a people&#8217;s history of the u.s.][8] [bill gates][9] and [enrique iglesias][10] are both reading ernest hemingway&#8217;s [the old man and the sea][11]. [weird al yankovic][12] is reading stephen hawking&#8217;s [a brief history of time][13], whereas [stephen hawking][14] is reading [marilyn monroe][15].

sunday morning was very nice. i woke up and immediately sat on my green plush armchair and read from start to finish a long awaited zine, number 6 of [zuzu and the babycatcher][16]. it was very good and as much as i enjoy the internet and spend so much time on it, i loved the smallness of it, it fit perfectly in my hands, and i loved the writing and drawings and the feeling of closing it when i finished. you should read it too.

<strike>bye!</strike> goodnight,

~andrea
