some of us are adjusting pretty quickly:

i&#8217;m being super super careful with my kittens, making sure they get comfortable with each new area &#8211; be it my room, the roof (!), the balcony, whatever &#8211; before i introduce the next new thing, but still, it&#8217;s a relief to see them settling in and not hating me forever. <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> that&#8217;s trouble at the gate and trouble first up the roof, mama cat following cautiously a little bit later. (my room is on the 2nd floor with a balcony that sits right next to the garage roof. trouble likes roofs, so this is a good sign.)

and me? happy to be dressing warmer, since it&#8217;s definitely cold here &#8211; today calls for comfy clothing, see? also, this morning i woke up and went straight to the library. nothing like a library card to make you feel more at home. such a librarian, huh.

i&#8217;m way behind on emails, reading other sites, and more. this weekend is full of family-ness, but i&#8217;ll be sure to catch up asap.

happy weekend ~ ~
