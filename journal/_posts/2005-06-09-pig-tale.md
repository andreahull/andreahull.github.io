## by Verlyn Flieger 

read this one in one night and a few rushed minutes in the morning, because i just couldn&#8217;t wait to find out what happens to mokie. i&#8217;m still puzzled and worrying about the ending &#8211; did she die? didn&#8217;t she? &#8211; which make me think there&#8217;s something big there i Didn&#8217;t Get, you know? but i liked it a lot &#8211; it rang true and had so much heart in describing the relationships between mokie and her three &#8216;mote beam&#8217; friends.

plus, it affected, i&#8217;m sure of it, some of the sweeter dreams i&#8217;ve had in a long time, leaving me trying for long long minutes that morning when i awake to get back to sleep, back to the dreams. that&#8217;s gotta be a sign of something good.
