[this][1] [day][2] has become one of my favorite holidays of the whole year. today&#8217;s celebration didn&#8217;t consist of a [maypole][3] or [walking in the streets][4], but instead a welcoming-summer outing for a couple of hours &#8211; just me, mamacat, trouble, and the whole big backyard. they were thrilled &#8211; tails twitching and lots of bounding and sniffing all over the place.

if they can get comfortable being outside more, and if i can feel safe about that, then it will make moving here feel that much better. (and yes, as you can see, mamacat stuck to the grass, alternating between eating it and being spooked by it. trouble worried me by staring up at trees and jumping onto ledges.)

now, off to bed, [tomorrow][5]&#8216;s an early day ~ ~
