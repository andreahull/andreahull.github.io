title: one project to go

hello.

i&#8217;m feeling a bit wiped out after this second-to-last project but i had to proudly present it here for any to look at (and please [tell me][1] if it doesn&#8217;t look right in your browser): [coca in bolivia][2].

also, thanks to my great brother-in-law john, i have a few very sweet pictures of my nephew nickolas up in [gallery][3], so take a look. i&#8217;ll be sure to put more family photos up soon. hey, and if anyone would rather i didn&#8217;t make these accessible to the public, then tell me and i&#8217;ll move &#8216;em quick as can be, ok?

i still have one more project to go, but thank goodness i don&#8217;t think it&#8217;ll be quite so hard as a)i&#8217;m less ambitious this time around, and b) the project is fairly structured, especially when compared with the archives one..

why in the world did i actually try my first push-ups ever last night? i&#8217;m already feeling pretty woo-woo woo-woo from sleep deprivation. and now, on top of that, my arms and the usually very squishy bit between by arms and armpit hurt and ache, ay!

i love bookmobiles, although i don&#8217;t think i&#8217;ve even been in one. (i vaguely remember something about a small walkable vehicle during a bible camp i went to when i was like 7 or 8. .. hm.) anyway, though [the internet archive][4] may have some problems as a serious archives, they sure do have an admirable amount of energy, optimism, and creativity. check out their very cool [internet bookmobile][5]! check out [the photos][6], including glimpses of the nice portable book binder they have.
