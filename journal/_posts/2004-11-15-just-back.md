hi there! just got back from the [california library association][1]&#8217;s annual conference up in san jose. i had such a great time, even though i only went to one workshop and two lectures/speeches. i&#8217;d never been to san jose before and i think my legs shrunk a little from all that driving and sitting in my little car, but it was well worth it. 

more details later, i&#8217;m pretty tired right now but:

  * ~ [walt crawford][2] is just as enjoyable in person as he is in [cites & insights][3] (which, if you&#8217;re a librarian/archivist and don&#8217;t read are seriously missing out on important digital info)
  * ~ san jose is quite veggie friendly; i recommend [vegetarian house][4] and [inca gardens][5] (which sadly might be forced to move at the end of this month but has delicious peruvian/andean food)
  * ~ i like watching wedding celebrations and i often end up crying
  * ~ trying to drive slower than 80 mph is hard after five hours on interstate 5
  * ~ [lemony snicket][6] (aka daniel handler) is just as funny and smart in person as you would think (and hope) he is, plus he has a cute kinda towny accent
  * ~ san jose&#8217;s new public library, the joint-use [martin luther king library][7], is one of the [best libraries][8] i think i&#8217;ve ever ever been in
  * ~ after taking the wireless networking workshop, i now understand the difference between [802.11b and 802.11i][9]
  * ~ i love having a working fridge &#8211; haven&#8217;t had to defrost it once yet! went away for two days, came back and the food is *still* good, can&#8217;t believe it
  * ~ an idea i had the other day already exists and it&#8217;s called &#8216;[power][10] [over][11] [ethernet][12]&#8217;
  * ~ ran out of my inca cotton yarn, darn (hey, rhyming!) and i still have a sleeve and a half to go
  * ~ i want [wimax][13], and so do you (even if you don&#8217;t know it yet)
  * ~ yay! i have a book package waiting at the post office
  * ~ despite feeling still a little creeped-out by the whole [aslan-as-jesus][14] and other religious references in his beloved kids&#8217; classics, i now like c.s. lewis a whole bunch more after seeing this great quote of his at that fabulous new library: 

# &#8220;some day you will be old enough to start reading fairy tales again&#8221;

good night and more info tomorrow,

andrea
