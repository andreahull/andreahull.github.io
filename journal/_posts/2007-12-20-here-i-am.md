and here&#8217;s a little gift from me to you: three christmas songs that have been in heavy rotation. i love many of the classic christmas songs &#8211; and last night i had a good helping of nat king cole, judy garland, the drifters, and so on &#8211; but sometimes you need something else, and right now, these feel just right.

[carla thomas &#8211; gee whiz, it&#8217;s christmas][1]

[diana krall &#8211; christmas time is here][2]

[prince &#8211; another lonely christmas][3]

christmas is full of so many memories, so many emotions &#8211; lots of happy stuff, but lots of wistfulness and introspection, no? i&#8217;m so tired, i&#8217;m just beat. so, nice music, give it a try.

and that&#8217;s that. i&#8217;ll be posting more between now and christmas &#8211; believe it! &#8211; and there&#8217;s some happy pictures and videos coming your way, never fear. and bolivia! wow, that trip is just around the corner &#8211; i had to get my yellow fever shot today in preparation, ouch &#8211; and it&#8217;s going to be amazing, i know it. 

enjoy the tunes ~ ~
