hello! as you can see*, it&#8217;s a beautiful saturday morning here in la paz, and we have a party to go to this afternoon outside of the city, but i wanted to write a quick update on how the book reading is going. 

first off: i&#8217;m already behind on my 52-books-in-one-year challenge. surprise, surprise! <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> i&#8217;m about 70% through [Hild][1] &#8211; i still like it quite a lot, but it&#8217;s very dense text, i can&#8217;t just skim over it like an albatross skims over the waves in the sea. (yikes, what a metaphor. and albatross? really, there&#8217;s got to be a better bird to use that has less doom and gloom associated with it. poor albatross.) nope, this book makes me pause and re-read and then mutter a bit out loud and so on. not because of its weighty ideas but because of the language &#8211; it&#8217;s gorgeous, yes, but oh my lordy, so archaic! and then it reads like a russian novel, with a billion and one characters, but at least they don&#8217;t each have half a dozen nicknames like good old Tolstoy. anyhow, so far, so good. i&#8217;m taking my time with that one. 

but! i found a bunch of excellent fantasy/science fiction books in Spanish, actually written by Bolivians &#8211; which is so cool, because i don&#8217;t know Bolivian literature at all, much less literature in the fantastic genre which i so very much love. i found a collection of Andean mythology, and i swear my heart sped up triple-time when i spotted it. so awesome. also, i started reading an anthology of fantastic fiction yesterday called [VÃ©rtigos][2] and already read two stories. hooray!

and! i&#8217;ve committed to read [Middlemarch][3] by George Eliot &#8211; i have to have two hundred pages read by the end of the month. yup, a 900+ book, known for its weighty nature indeed. 

so. reading this month is going swimmingly. knock on wood. happy weekend! 

*this is part of the view from our bedroom & a big reason as to why we grabbed this apartment as soon as we found it. <3 you should have seen new years&#8217; eve from here&#8230;!
