hi~

today so far has been a very nice day&#8212;it&#8217;s rained a lot in l.a. recently and as a result it&#8217;s just green all over with beautiful puffy blue skies. 

these links are making me happy and giving me ideas about my cats (chuckling evily and rubbing my hands together in anticipation..) : [why cats paint][1] and [dancing with cats][2]. (all part of [monpa][3], or the museum of non-primate art.) i just love it! in fact, i have an address book that uses photos from cats who paint. it&#8217;s great. <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" class="wp-smiley" />

i got good news from my boss today. i&#8217;m still a temp, after over a year of working here, which is pretty frustrating to say the least. but i was just informed that maybe [the archives][4] will pay for me to attend [the society of american&#8217;s archivists&#8217;][5] annual meeting that will be held in boston this coming august. just too cool for words.

finally, i got the comments thing running so please write something, ok? i first tried creating one myself using php and mysql but it was really just too advanced for me. sucks! but then i foundt [this great list][6] of different commenting programs, some that you host on your own server (such as the one i&#8217;m using, [symbio][7]) and some that are hosted for free on others&#8217; servers (such as [haloscan][8]). [symbio][7] is a cgi script written in perl which i have basically no understanding of but the installation wasn&#8217;t that hard after an hour or so of scratching my head. highly recommended &#8211; but see for yourself!

[creative commons][9], a group working to change copyright and liscensing by offering a easy customizable liscence for creative works, just had a contest to see who could create a short movie showcasing and explaining creative commons&#8217; different liscences. here are the [winners][10].

recently, i&#8217;ve been reading and thinking a little bit about copyright, and intellectual property in general. mostly that&#8217;s due to my involvement of (don&#8217;t laugh) a [librarians&#8217; online book club][11] and for this month we&#8217;re discussing paul goldstein&#8217;s 1994 book &#8216;Copyright&#8217;s Highway: From Gutenberg to the Celestial Jukebox&#8217;. i&#8217;ll write some more and post links soon.

wow! i just read that mcdonald&#8217;s is phasing out their &#8216;supersize&#8217; menu. could that be a direct reaction to [this documentary][12]? 

according to an [ap article][13], &#8220;an award-winning documentary called &#8220;[Super Size Me][12]&#8221; has heaped on more unwanted publicity on McDonalds. The documentary chronicles the deterioration of filmmaker Morgan Spurlock&#8217;s health during a monthlong experiment eating nothing but McDonald&#8217;s food. It won a directing prize at the Sundance Film Festival and is set for wide release this spring. Riker [a mcdonalds rep] said the phasing out of super-sizing has &#8220;nothing to do with that (film) whatsoever.&#8221; The company earlier issued a statement calling the documentary &#8220;a super-sized distortion of the quality, choice and variety available at McDonald&#8217;s.&#8221; It says the film is not about McDonald&#8217;s but about Spurlock&#8217;s decision to act irresponsibly by eating 5,000 calories a day &#8211; &#8220;a gimmick to make a film.&#8221; &#8221;

seems like the gimmick worked. ha!

p.s. for some reason, i&#8217;m pretty interested in the [blind and how they read][14].
