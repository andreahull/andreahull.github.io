so far it&#8217;s treating me loads better than september. how so? <span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="703" /></span>for one, i have a happy secret (not involving any rings or bellies, no worries) i&#8217;ll hopefully share in a while, two, the weather is definitely a bit fall-ish, very blustery at least, which makes me grin, and three, i received this great package from the so nice & clever [cassie][1]. i hadn&#8217;t mentioned much about the [syno swap][2] up to now, because i was procrastinating horribly, although i have till the end of october, thank goodness&#8230; but now i absolutely have to! look what came in the mail yesterday:

first off, a mini-[buttonhole bag][3]! i&#8217;ve been eyeing the pattern for months, and then this shows up.<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="704" /></span> yay!

oh yes, what&#8217;s inside? lush soap! in an enclosed card, cassie wrote that as she read that i don&#8217;t like candy &#8211; must have been from those sugar-free days <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> &#8211; she got me some non-candy. when i read that, i thought &#8216;please don&#8217;t let it be sunflower seeds, or raisins, or&#8230;&#8217; and then the smell hit my nose. my! 

i love love [lush products][4] &#8211; just got into them this past august, but since then, i&#8217;ve developed a major passion for them. and honestly, at the risk of sounding too infomercial-ly, my skin and hair has never been happier. double yay. the soaps &#8211; three of them, count &#8216;em! &#8211; are delicious <span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="705" /></span>and i can&#8217;t wait to use them.

thank you so much cassie ~ and yes, you clever girl, this has already motivated me to get cracking on your turtleneck shrug &#8211; though the heavenliness of the yarn (cashmere silk!) is doing it&#8217;s own motivating too <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> 

~ happy friday ~

p.s. here&#8217;s an update pic of my cable-and-lace sleeve with it&#8217;s color change. i decided to go all dramatic and do a very deep &#8216;cuff&#8217;. it&#8217;s pretty huh?

update: can&#8217;t help it, my mom just sent me some pics of when my sisters were born, and they just take. me. back. sigh. i love station wagons! and that other pic is of my siblings, me, and my dad peeking in the nursery window. ahh.
