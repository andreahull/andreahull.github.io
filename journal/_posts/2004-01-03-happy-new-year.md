hi ~

i had a great christmas and holiday-time in maryland and i just realized yesterday that school doesn&#8217;t start for me till jan. 12th. yay! my new years was very great and i love just having to work but not do anything else right now. i&#8217;ve been working on [this booklist][1] and soon will have it just right. i&#8217;m thinking of making some big changes visually and am playing around with different layouts. fun! 

goodnight!
