hello ~ the last day of march! this month has been so long but still, as always, i&#8217;m suprised to reach the end of it..

last night, totally by accident, i ended up watching episode two of pbs&#8217; [the new americans][1] series. it was really good ~ tonight is episode three, and i&#8217;m really looking forward to it. basically, it follows the stories of five or so different recent immigrants to the u.s. one is a mexican day laborer who is trying to get working visas for his family of 8. another is a recently wed palestinian woman. then there&#8217;s two domincan baseball players. and then there&#8217;s three nigerians, one a couple that is expecting their second child, and the other is a mother of two teenage girls, who also happens to be the sister of the famous nigerian activist [ken saro-wiwa][2] who was killed while [fighting ][3] the nigerian gov&#8217;t and shell. you should watch it!

one of my favorite magazines, [stay free magazine][4], just posted an interview with [rick prelinger][5] who, working with [the internet archive][6] has just posted [over 1,900 &#8220;ephemeral&#8221; films][7], that is, advertising, educational, industrial, and amateur films. now you too can watch the infamous &#8216;duck and cover&#8217; (learning simple steps to save yourself if hit by a nuclear bomb), as well as &#8216;booked for safekeeping&#8217; (about imprisoning the mentally ill), &#8216;a is for atom&#8217; (the many uses of nuclear fission), &#8216;act your age&#8217; (an immature youth struggles to grow up and get popular) and much more. it&#8217;s awesome. (avaible as downloads in lots of formats, including real player and quicktime. go internet archive!)

[library journal][8] just released their annual [movers and shakers][9], which highlights lots (this year, 55) of librarians that they consider are real, yeah, movers and shakers. anyhow, the list is always fun to read and i always (at least for two years now) have lots of fun fantasizing i will be a profiled mover and shaker, one day. <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" class="wp-smiley" /> so silly. but really, is there a similar one for archivists? i don&#8217;t think so. and so there&#8217;s yet another reason i should maybe turn to public librarianship instead of archival stuff. hm. so, anway, here&#8217;s some cool people: [troy johnson][10] of [librarian&#8217;s book club][11] fame (which got re-designed and looks good), [christin borne][12] who set up [the next gen librarian listerv][13] (& [website][14], and [matthew battles][15] who wrote the excellent [library: an unquiet history][16].

last but not least, for those that have outdoor gardening space (you lucky dogs), check out [you grow girl: garderning for the people][17]. not only is it a pretty and web standards compliant page, it also has lots of forums, articles, pretty pictures, an online store, etc. to satisfy those with the gardening itch.

bye,

~ andrea
