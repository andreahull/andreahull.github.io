~ fox (crossing the street, many times now. eyes flashing in the glare of the headlights, tail always bouncy and beautiful.)  
~ slug (in my left rainboot, just a little one.)  
~ bird (in nest, on top of a ledge in the lower garage, sitting very still as i pulled the car in)   
~ koi fish (only by the deck, the ones by the gazebo are gone &#8211; heron ate them(!) )  
~ frogs (orchestra every night. my dad used to collect them by the bucket & take them to the canal where it&#8217;s all park land. my mom keeps dropping hints i should do it too. hm.)  
~ tadpoles (there are so many they deserve their own line)  
~ dragonfly (three days now, the same blue one, i think)  
~ neighbor&#8217;s dogs (annoying yips)  
~ our dogs (the best sweethearts)  
~ my cats (loving their new cat beds & scratch lounge-things)  
~ junebugs (pepper, my black cat from many years ago, used to love to snack on them)  
~ fireflies (official summer bug, i love them.)  
~ moth (giant grey beauty in the horse&#8217;s stable, and made a straight beeline to my red clogs. oh! and another one clinging to the side of a gas station pump. aqua colors. &#8212; just found out, it&#8217;s called a luna moth. <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> )  
~ horses (they&#8217;re getting re-used to the halter. and coats are gleaming. except when it just rained & then they&#8217;re encrusted with mud. they like to play.)  
~ bees (ginormous ones and plain old little honeybees. wish we had a beehive still.)  
~ beaver (chomping very loudly on some greens near the canal)  
~ deer (many, most of them alive ;(. and one sitting by the side of the road with cars flashing their hazards as they parked, got out, and approached the deer. i kept driving but worried. :Z)  
~ fish (fish tanks upstairs and downstairs. now that my mom&#8217;s back, she looks after them.)  
~ sheep (at poole&#8217;s store)  
~ turkey (ditto)  
~ chickens (ditto. baby chicks too, but now they&#8217;re outside, no longer in the box in the store with a heat lamp over them.)  
~ ducks and geese (fed them bread with my nieces & nephew last weekend, at a nearby manmade pond / shopping complex thing)  
~ snake (in the stable&#8217;s attic, as i was loading up horse food. black little beauty.)
