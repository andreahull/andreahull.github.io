i have way more notes, pictures, and even a video or two to share from the *fabulous* judith mackenzie mccuin workshop &#8211; i can&#8217;t recommend more highly her workshops. i&#8217;ll definitely be on the lookout for more, it&#8217;s just amazing how much info that woman can pack in a one-day session, much less three.

for now, from [knitbuddies][1]:
