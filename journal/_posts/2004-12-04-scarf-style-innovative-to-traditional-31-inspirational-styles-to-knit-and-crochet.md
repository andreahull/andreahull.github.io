this was a total impulse buy that i slightly regretted later &#8211; not just because impulse buys are moments of weakness that *must be* stamped out but becuase as pretty as these scarf patterns are &#8211; as original and creative, too &#8211; i&#8217;ve never been a big scarf lady. and living in los angeles doesn&#8217;t exactly help that feeling change in the least bit.

however, with that said, the scarfs are trully beautiful and i&#8217;ve decided i must make a few for my poor freezing family in maryland. and thus, the regret completely vanished. phew.
