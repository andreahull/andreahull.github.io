<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="774" /></span>a few weeks ago, a friend of mine at my old workplace gave me something he said he&#8217;s been carrying around for years and didn&#8217;t really know what it did but that he thought maybe i&#8217;d know what to do with it, so he gave it to me. imagine my surprise when i see a lovely miniature wooden swift! i was so tickled pink all day long &#8211; and that was a day that needed tickling, believe me you.

then, on christmas day, what do i get from my brother and sister-in-law but a lovely ball winder! wow. they kinda shrugged smiling when i opened it, saying they had no idea what it was for or why i wanted it, but it was on my list, so there i go. <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> 

therefore, for these non-knitterly friends and family, i present you with skeining 101.

and yup, that&#8217;s some handspun there &#8211; it&#8217;s oh-so-satisfying to skein up your own spun yarn. though i did wince now and then at the uneveness, oh well. <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" />
