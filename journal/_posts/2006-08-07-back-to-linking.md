<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="904" /></span>~ [knitting simplicity][1], where &#8220;the idea is to step back from the rampant consumption that seems to have taken over the knitting blogosphere.&#8221; [via [liz][2]]

~ [harry potter][3]: john irving and stephen king plead with j.k. rowling to not kill harry in book 7. hm, i&#8217;m more worried about the weasley twins, ron, and hermione. 

~ with no cable and a tv reception that has gone down to 0 channels, [this handy list][4] of tv on the net is perfect for those times when i&#8217;m feeling a television urge and [youtube][5] is not cutting it. 

~ check out this [nyc green roof][6], complete with porch and meadow. nice, but only for one family? imagine if all the city buildings had these and they were treated like parks, open to all. <span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="905" /></span>

~ [the perfect gift][7] &#8211; very very tempted to do this for the family this year. (though [paperback][8] is more appealing for some reason.) chicas, if you&#8217;re reading this, act surprised in december <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> 

~ also, from the above article, a quote: â€œBooks are breaking wide open&#8230; Books are becoming vehicles that arenâ€™t static things.â€? hm, for bookworms, books have *never* been static things. but i love seeing the elite idea of authors knocked off its pedestal now that anyone can make a book that looks just as good as any mega-corporate publisher&#8217;s book. 

~ [new yorker article][9] and [atlantic monthly article][10] on wikipedia, both interesting in regards to wikipedia&#8217;s background/history

~ i recently saw the most recent pirates of the caribbean and i must say, i enjoyed it more than i thought i would. [this article][11] explains some of the interest, though really, how can i fail to be charmed by a film that has my mom laughing so hard she&#8217;s crying for minutes and minutes at a time?

~ making your internet-browsing [work friendly][12] by displaying it in a word 2003 format <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" />

~ [the deluded world of air conditioning][13]. i didn&#8217;t realize a/c affects gas consumption as much as 4 gallons per mile. !

some picture explanation: the first is a quote that got my goat (ha! i&#8217;m a poet, didn&#8217;t know it, my feet showed it, they&#8217;re longfellows. .. hm, anyone else know that saying? my dad used to say it all the time when i was little and it stuck. um. ).. anywho, that quotation can be found on a random ucla building &#8211; and why? no idea. so cheery, it made me all grumpy just looking at it. so, yup, took a photo of it. several in fact. second pic is from the getty where i attended a reception this past friday. i like it because from far away, it looks like a bit of moss and stuff growing teeny-tiny in some little forgotten corner somewhere but in reality, it&#8217;s a human-sized grove of trees/large bushes in the corner of a big old building. moss for giants, perhaps. 

work is kicking my butt. and as for months now, i&#8217;m missing horribly irrevocably giant parts of my life. looking and seeing hints everywhere, my heart stops and leaps into my throat, turning flip-flops & falling out as butterflies, and then.. nothing. not there. just a giant headache and a squeezing fist. i&#8217;ve lost my life &#8211; but i keep waking up, and smiling and eating and cooing to my cats and planning and dreaming&#8230; how can that be? ah, here comes the existential me. few of you out there know that andrea.

ok, that&#8217;s my cue to step away from the keyboard. off to get some pure sugar to sustain me through the day, tsk tsk. more knitting soon ~ and some music content via a new-to-me idea. happy august ~ ~
