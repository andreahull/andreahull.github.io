this was a pretty easy project &#8211; but lots of fun color-wise and also seeing the butterfly &#8216;come to life&#8217;. also, this was the first time i ever crocheted&#8212;the edges around the butterfly wings was crocheted. 

some modifications were made: 

~ the width of the scarf went from 2&#8221; to a little over 3&#8221; (12 stitches to 17).

~ stripes were added to the scarf which, i thought, made the scarf and butterfly fit together a little bit better style-wise. 

~ instead of attaching the butterfly to the scarf, i knitted an i-cord on the back of the butterfly and made a little loop to fit the scarf through&#8212;this way if my cousin, the gift recipient&#8212;didn&#8217;t like the butterfly (gasp!) or wanted to use it somehwere else apart from the sweater (that&#8217;s more like it!) then she could.

~ lastly, since i widened the scarf, i doubled the size of the butterfly so it&#8217;d fit better. but, with that doubling came a little more floppiness than probably there should&#8217;ve been. so, please be kind and don&#8217;t tell me the butterfly looks more like a moth, ok?

finished: march 6, 2005  
pattern: butterfly scarf from [stitch &#8216;n bitch nation][1]  
yarn: 3 hanks of crystal palace chenille (lots of left over yarn though!)  
needles: size 5 straights&#8212;size 6s, though on gauge, made a too-loose knit that i wasn&#8217;t crazy about.
