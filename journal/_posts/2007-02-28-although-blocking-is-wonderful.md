alas, it&#8217;s not enough. this is the center panel to my poetry in stitches sweater and it&#8217;s measuring.. wait for it.. 30 inches! that&#8217;s a pretty long sweater, folks. 

so, i&#8217;ll admire the prettiness of it, but i&#8217;m afraid it&#8217;ll have to be knit again. one question: take out a repeat or go down a needle size or two? (that would mean size 1s or 0s &#8211; though the yarn could handle it as it&#8217;s practically laceweight yarn.) i have the rest of the body (the whole lice part), measuring about 20 inches, on hold, waiting to see how this center panel goes length-wise so now&#8217;s the chance to make it a shorter or longer sweater. (it&#8217;s supposed to measure 25 inches long according to the pattern.) whatcha think?
