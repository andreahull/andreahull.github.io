i&#8217;m a fixer, a troubleshooter, i can figure things out and find the answers. that&#8217;s my job as a librarian, as a code tinkerer on this website and others, as the curious girl i was then and am now. lately though, big and little things have fallen apart. things put off for too long are coming to haunt me and worse. things that as a 20 year old i could excuse on ignorance perhaps are no longer tolerable. 

i have to fix them, figure them out. there&#8217;s no other choice. why the drama? because it&#8217;s easy to think it&#8217;s too late, full of should-haves and could-haves that end up feeling like nevers. step by step though, i will fix them. and it&#8217;s never too late. not really.

proof? my tomato plants. i sowed them in march but didn&#8217;t get them in the ground until after the fourth of july &#8211; they were unhappy leggy seedlings by then and i doubted anything would come of them much less fruit. and now? if my computer hadn&#8217;t fried to bits this past weekend, i would show you some beautiful pics. it&#8217;s amazing. tomatos as big as my fist, tons of little cherry romas all green and sweet-looking, happy stretching plants reaching behind the limits of the fence, trying to touch the sun. looking at them in july anyone would have said, no, too late, this won&#8217;t work.

i&#8217;m running out the door right now, but those tomatos, that&#8217;s the image stuck in my mind. 

happy september to you all ~ pictures once i get my computer up and purring again.
