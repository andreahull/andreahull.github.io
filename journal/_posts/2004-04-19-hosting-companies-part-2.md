hi there.

ok, it&#8217;s been a bunch of days since i last wrote, i know, but i&#8217;ve been getting really fed up with the instability of my hosting people, [the hosting specialist][1]. if my site wasn&#8217;t actually down, then either the cpanel was entirely unreachable or, even worse, none of the mysql databases were up and running, resulting in ugly googedly-gunk right in this space here instead of a nice message from me. so, not exactly the most encouraging motivation to post anything. i know, somewhat my fault. (i.e. i&#8217;m paying $2 a month, what kind of service should i really expect?) last night thoug, i made the jump: i switched hosts once again, after a bunch of hours of research.  
looking around, the [webhosting talk forums][2] seemed the best place to do some searching for a good host. though there seemed to be a lot of fighting between staff from different hosting companies which made some threads kinda hard to follow (try following a fight between computer people and unless a lot of cuss words are being thrown around, it gets real dorky real quick.), overall i could get a feel for the different hosting possibilities.

also, i thought i&#8217;d check where my favorite sites, both personal and larger, are hosted themselves, since they in general seem to have no real problem with downtime, which was my biggest concern. so, i looked real hard at [dreamhost][3], [united hosting in the uk][4], and [westhost][5].

lastly, i looked at exactly what do i need now that i&#8217;m a little bit more experience than i was when i first moved this site off of geocities in december (was it only december? wow. time moves so quickly!). basically my list was:

</p> 

  * Â» **lots of storage:** i didn&#8217;t want to worry about that at all, and i like my [gallery][6] and [shorts][7] pages alot, which take up the biggest space
  * Â» **decent bandwidth:** i use a pitifully small amount of bandwidth (sob) so i didn&#8217;t need the 40 gb of bandwidth some hosting places said they could provide (ha! som much overselling out there..)

  * Â» **a nice cpanel:** ok, i&#8217;m a sucker for flashy pretty control panels, with all the latest gadgets, especially pretty [awstats][8], which is **much** better than webalizer


  * Â» **php 4.x and at the least one mysql database**: i like playing around with code everyonce in a while, and more importantly, some basic aspects of my little site depend on these php/mysql, mainly my [booklist][9], (a nice little app called [oddbook][10] from jessamyn west of [librarian.net][11] fame) and these posts both here on this page and, all saved and nicely ordered, on [my past page][12]
  * Â» **a strong community:** i love hosting forums! filled with computer-geek-talk, and links to personal sites, and annoying/amusing animated gifs and emoticons, oh the fun never stops. plus, we could all gripe about the hosting provider together <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" class="wp-smiley" />


  * Â» **general support:** this was my main issue with the two places i&#8217;d hosted with already. [phpwebhosting][13] was ok, and much better than the hosting specialist people, but not that good really. i knew that if there was a pretty vibrant forum, like i&#8217;ve heard dreamhost has, and others, then there was more likely to be frequent announcements of routine server maintenance, etc etc. plus, lunarpages has unlimited toll-free phone support. you just can&#8217;t beat that..
</ul> 

so, ultimately, i went with [lunarpages][14]. they have a very strong [community forum][15], a really good plan (800 mb of space, with more than enough bandwidth), very decent price ($8 a month), and such a good reputation it made me wary for a few hours. the only drawback was they only offered one mysql database. unlimited tables, but still only one db. so.. i looked around a little bit and found out i could get an extra database for $1/month, as many as i wanted. i was willing to pay up to $10/month (and even more if i felt desperate to to find a good reliable host), so if i really need more than one database in the future, i can get up to 2 more and still not go over my limit. yay!

now, it&#8217;s a matter of waiting for my domain registrating people ([gandi][16]) to &#8216;propogate&#8217; the dns and all that, and changing the mysql info to the new hostname, etc, and then i&#8217;m set! **update**: looks like the dns worked though still a bit wobbly, not i just need the mysql stuff to get right..) i&#8217;m very excited, mostly because i&#8217;ve just felt so isolated with the hosting specialist people. i don&#8217;t know **who** else hosts with them, i never know **ahead of time** when my site will be down, or really why it&#8217;s been down for hours (and hours and hours) at a time, and so on.

another extra for me is that lunarpages is located real nearby in la mirada, california. and their servers are at the scarily-close [one wilshire][17] building downtown, so if i ever have a problem with them, i know where to go <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" class="wp-smiley" />

before i go though, i got a question: why don&#8217;t people write about their hosting issues/migrations/frustrations more? it&#8217;s amazing how hard it is to find opinions about hosts on people&#8217;s personal sites! i ended up having to go to a [whois][18] to find the hosting providers of a lot of my favorite sites, and rely on complete unknowns at the webhosting talk forum. frustrating! really, believe me, it&#8217;s super cathartic to write about your hosting experience. i&#8217;m still keeping my account with the hosting specialist people, but i&#8217;m going to use it strictly as a storage space for large files, like photos and stuff like that.

have a great monday! i can&#8217;t believe the weekend passed so fast.  
oh! and p.s. it&#8217;s national library week. have you hugged a librarian today?

p.s. 2: i just signed up with [lunarpages&#8217;][14] affiliate program so if anyone signs up with them, by clicking [this link][14] they earn me a cool $52 for refering them. i only need two of those to pay for the the whole year of hosting. swwwweeeeeet. <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" class="wp-smiley" /> anyone? anyone? (bueller? bueller?)
