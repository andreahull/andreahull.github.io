today’s my birthday! it’s already been a great 9 hours+ and it’s only 9:25 am.

third-trimester pregnancy means a lot of insomnia for me, but last night i enjoyed it, going through the past year, and past years, and feeling so grateful for my life, for the changes of this year, for those i love, for the baby to come, for the excitement of the future.

so. i’m off to enjoy the day ~ i hope you do the same. hooray! 

p.s. that&#8217;s me in the foto, circa late 1977. good year. <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> past 3/4s: [2008][1], [2007][2], [2006][3], [2005][4], [2004][5]
