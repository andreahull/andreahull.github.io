<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="842" /></span>last night i couldn&#8217;t get to sleep and i kept remembering [past][1] [may days][2] &#8211; like four years ago when i wore a favorite handmade dress of mine and marched in the streets with friends and [three years ago][3] when i moved into this much loved apartment. i remember it all like yesterday. sometimes, very often, the past seems more real and nearer to me than the present &#8211; and though that&#8217;s not a good thing in many ways, today, right now, it makes me feel lucky. 

for those of you that don&#8217;t listen, or don&#8217;t know about *democracy now!*, now would be a good time to [listen to it, or watch it][4]. it&#8217;s a radio-turned-tv show and it&#8217;s just excellent. it&#8217;s pacifica&#8217;s best, really the only program i listen to anymore and i&#8217;m proud to have helped and worked with democracy now! during my time at pacifica. anyhow, [check it out][4], i don&#8217;t think you&#8217;ll be disappointed.

for the first time in years, i&#8217;m off to a march &#8211; i went to the tail-end of one a few weeks ago with some new friends and though i was nervous of seeing people i don&#8217;t really want to see, it was great being there, in that atmosphere of possible change and hope for the future. today, i&#8217;m going alone, hoping the turnout is amazing and that the voices and goals of the marchers are heard. 

years ago, when i used to go to demonstrations on a pretty regular basis, i had friends to go with. i&#8217;ll miss them &#8211; and have been missing them &#8211; a lot, but i lost them, so today will be bittersweet. 

sorry if i&#8217;m making no sense ~ in short, [happy][5] [may][6] [day][7], happy day of solidarity and workers&#8217; struggle for justice. this country we live in is screwed up on so many levels, change *must* happen. i&#8217;m afraid of what will most definitely happen if it doesn&#8217;t.

p.s. i&#8217;m very late on emails and responding to comments &#8211; i&#8217;ll try to catch up in the next few days. thanks.

just realized the times are off in the image &#8211; taken from the l.a. times website. the first march is at noon, not 11 am, and the second at 3, not 4 pm. argh.
