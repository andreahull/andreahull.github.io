summer is great for remembering how times were as a kid. really, it&#8217;s such a nostalgic season, but not just in your mind, but also literally doing what you did as a kid. marveling at gorgeous summer sunsets. smiling as fireflies dance around you as you walk through the woods at dusk. biking down a dirt path along the river and passing log after log, half submerged in the water with families of turtles sunning &#8212; heads arched up to catch the maximum sunlight, tails and feet even stretched out. sitting in the car on a road trip &#8211; in this case a mini one, to my uncle&#8217;s for the day &#8211; listening and singing along to old music, feet propped up.

i wrote the above fourth of july. here&#8217;s some drawings too that remind me of being a kid and just doodling and having a permanent callus from holding a pencil all the time &#8211; it&#8217;s funny, now i try to write and after twenty minutes my hand hurts. what a softie! i would have scoffed and felt superior as a kid &#8211; and i would be right, ha. anyhow, after age 10 or so, i didn&#8217;t like to draw, i got too self-conscious about it, but now and then in the past two years i&#8217;ve started again.
