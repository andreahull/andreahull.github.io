i started writing something and it was just coming out too heavy, too much. so i saved it, i don&#8217;t like erasing history, but enough of that. how are you? i&#8217;m doing o.k. 

i haven&#8217;t been doing much on the craftsy front for a while now.. though come to think of it, last night i sewed on a ton of girl scout badges on a vest for my niece. but besides that, i haven&#8217;t been doing much craftsy stuff besides my garden and orchard work, which doesn&#8217;t *quite* fit into that category. i&#8217;ve been meaning to draw for a while, and then the wheel and needles call out to me at times too (especially since i got the maryland sheep and wool festival catalog, yay), but all in all, i&#8217;ve been too busy with my new library job (two months now!) and other projects and priorities.. and i don&#8217;t miss it half as much as i thought i would. 

i mean, i wish i could do everything all the time, but i can&#8217;t. and as much as i love making things with my hands, i&#8217;ve found so many ways to do that beyond knitting.. it&#8217;s pretty great, now that i think of it. ! when i first started knitting, i didn&#8217;t really think of myself as creative or very capable with my hands, capable at making things, but since then, i&#8217;ve taken on a ton of little projects and curioisties, and i&#8217;ve learned that my hands can do anything almost. it just takes a little time and effort. and along with my hands, my head has gotten better at figuring things out, feeling confident that i can do almost anything as long as i take my time and give it some thought. even though sometimes, i&#8217;ve learned, barreling through will *also* work. just a little bit messier, that&#8217;s for sure. !

anyhow, besides that realization, my life has been a balancing act that so far, when i think about it outside of the righthererightnow moment, is pretty great and full.. there&#8217;s online projects, plans and dreams to get started on already, family to appreciate and be with while i&#8217;m around, outdoor work galore here at the family house, and then add in sleeping and eating and working (adjusting to that forty-hour workload) and so on. basically, like all of you, i&#8217;m busy! it&#8217;s easy to get caught in an exausted/cranky/whatever mode, and i think i was for a while, but besides the regular dips and lows that happen to everyone, things are looking way better than they did even a year ago. even six months ago. and that&#8217;s important to appreciate.

so, with that said, i&#8217;ll post some pictures later. i just wanted to write something, to remind myself and everyone else, i haven&#8217;t given up. i&#8217;m here, and i have plans and dreams that will come true. or that&#8217;s the goal, at least. ! 

happy thursday ~ ~ thanks for reading.
