## by Donna Jo Napoli

such a good book &#8211; read it in one sitting, until the very end, when i got up and started pacing in circles, willing myself to read faster and faster, but not wanting it to end. i really enjoy all of napoli&#8217;s books (except the venice ones, don&#8217;t know why) and this one was no exception &#8211; it wasn&#8217;t as good as *spinners* or *zel* (those *still* tu at my heart, sigh) but it was good in a way only contemporary novels can be.

alvin is such a likeable boy and his uncanny luck borders, at times, on pure magic, i love that. but what really makes this book shine is the amount of detail the author weaves in, the depth and complexity of the characters doesn&#8217;t hurt too much either <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" />

can&#8217;t wait to read more of her books!
