a package from japan &#8211; what a great way to end my doggone draining day! (gotta love alliteration..)

how did my pal know i love socks, how, i ask you?! i knitted cuffs yesterday on my first pair of socks and i&#8217;m loving them already. besides that, for two years running now, at the top of my christmas list (yes, we still make those in my family even though we&#8217;re all grown up <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> ) has been socks &#8211; long skinny ones, snug anklets, whatever! 

two disclaimers: those two skinny pink things you see on the floor in some of the pics are little pieces of yarn from a really old rug-hooking project that somehow my cats managed to find and scatter all over my floor. sheesh! &#8230; second, my pinky toe is weird. it &#8216;hides&#8217; under the other toes and so that&#8217;s why my feet might look slightly, ummm, .. weird. (it runs in the family, though, so at least we&#8217;re all weird together.) 

as a point of pride, you *will* notice my second toe is slightly longer than my third &#8211; and this means, i was told at a tender impressionable age, that i am smarter than my mother. ahem. 

p.s. although the package came from japan, i have heard about past pals getting friends to send packages from other places just to throw their pal-ees (there really should be a word to distinguish the receiver of the gifts and the sender of them!) off track. hmm, are you *that* sneaky, oh pal o&#8217; mine?
