hey there ~ two happy realizations:

1) for many, a justification for spinning is that you won&#8217;t spend so much money on yarn, and i gotta say it&#8217;s true! it&#8217;s hard for me to buy yarn i know i can make (or at least, will be able to make once i get better at spinning), unless it&#8217;s on a severe sale or i have a project in mind and it Must Be Knit Now. in reality, that&#8217;s meant less than $40 of yarn bought since august, wooohoo! 

2) when i do get in the mood to yarn shop, the funnest thing to do lately is buy sample cards and patterns.. like eunny&#8217;s [argyle vest][1], for my first steeking adventure (yikes), and [knitpicks][2], [peace fleece][3], and [bartlett yarn][4] sample cards. cheap, or even free shipping, a feeling of maturity and look-how-responsible-i-am, and mail to look forward to &#8211; all good things.

besides that, my [syno][5] scarf arrived! and finally, the syno shrug i knit was finally sent today to [cassie][6]. i hope she likes it! i&#8217;m obviously not very good with deadlines and will think at least three times before committing to something like this again, no matter how cool and tempting it is, like [syno][5] was. <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> 

~ they&#8217;re making a [*dark crystal* sequel][7]! that was such a spooky good movie, yay. plus, i love puppets, always have &#8211; they&#8217;re creepy but fun. [via [site & soundbytes][8]]

~ [celtic chart generator][9] will create a chart for any text you want knitted [via [helloyarn][10]]

~ article on [early retirement][11], hm. [via [kottke][12]]

~ [knit graffiti][13]! [via [not martha][14]]

~ check out [you tube][15], they have an amazing amount of tv clips, old and new, really great, and alll free. like my favorite video [a-ha&#8217;s take on me][16] (i had such a crush on the lead singer, he was like my ideal man, no joke.) 

~ the always amazing [pluckyfluff][17] has crazy [plying thread][18] for sale that glows in the dark and changes color in sunlight. wow!

~ next time you&#8217;re bored at work, [draw a house][19]. silly, but once you&#8217;re done, it&#8217;ll be put on a &#8216;street&#8217; with other houses. although some people drew [amazing stuff][20], [my cottage][21] is a little weak-looking. but hey, i&#8217;m waving, and see, no lawn, yay.

~ check out the preview for [brokeback to the future][22]. ha, love it! [via [miri][23]]

i&#8217;m having a dinner party with some ex-co-workers tomorrow, too cool. we&#8217;re such a varied group, it&#8217;s bound to be an excellent time. they&#8217;re all foodies of some type or another, so it&#8217;s gotta be good food, i&#8217;m planning the menu now. also, tomorrow is a spinning guild meeting, yay. i&#8217;m hoping to buy some dye, should be fun. then, my horseback riding class on sunday &#8211; so far i&#8217;m loving loving it. i&#8217;m hoping we canter this weekend, i used to love cantering. ..!

hope you all have lovely weekends as well ~ ~
