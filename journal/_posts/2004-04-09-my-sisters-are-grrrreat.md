hi!

it&#8217;s been a few hectic days &#8211; i&#8217;m now in maryland, visiting my family for the easter weekend. it&#8217;s so great to be here: my parents picked me up this morning, the twins arrive tonight from north carolina, my older sister and her husband come back from vacation in fla. tomorrow, and hopefully i&#8217;ll see my brother, sister-in-law, and their two gorgeous kids tonight. yay!

i posted some pictures i took [here][1]. oh it&#8217;s so nice to be home! i wonder how long i&#8217;ll comfortably call two places home at the same time. where i lived before in l.a. (loft, communal house), i&#8217;m realizing now, i never really called home i don&#8217;t think. definitely not as comfortably as i call my pretty catalina apartment home. it&#8217;s pretty here in maryland right now &#8211; spring is very evident, with nodding daffodils, sweet little buds all over the place, and the grass so green and soft.

[my sisters are grrrrreat!][2]

i&#8217;ll write more later..
