in other words, some random thoughts:

i got raindrunk this weekend. never heard of that kind of drunk? well, it&#8217;s one that only afflicts ex-east coasters living in southern california. saturday night it rained, just twenty minutes of heavy rain, and i was all grinning and sighing. for those of you having days upon days of rain, i probably sound a tad bizarre, but really, you gotta experience at least five so. cal. summers and then you&#8217;ll get it ( i wasn&#8217;t like this last year.. but, no, i guess i&#8217;ve always been a bit of a rain freak. i used to love to swim in the rain. and i still always love jumping in puddles. hey, i&#8217;m a pisces, what can i say.)

after almost *four* years of carting around a [soap-making kit][1], for some reason this morning i just put down the book i was reading, walked over to a clost, and pulled out that kit. two hours later, i had soap. or rather, something that promises to be soap but for now is highly caustic and poisonous(!). since it was my first batch of soap ever, i thought, what the heck, and added in some cornmeal (for exfoliating purposes) and attempted to add some color by marblizing the soap with some nutmeg-color. we&#8217;ll see what comes out &#8211; after saponification, the soap needs to cure for at least three weeks. ([and][2] [then][3] [i got][4] [lost in][5] [soap][6] [window][7] [shopping][3] <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> )

which is worse: talking to oneself on-and-off for hours *or* not talking for hours and then be totally startled to hear sound come out of your mouth?

i&#8217;ve been cooking a lot recently ~ i forgot how much i love trying out new recipes so it&#8217;s been really nice just going all into it again. i was in a very cheese mood yesterday so i made [moosewood][8]&#8217;s [apple cheese gratin][9]. it was good, but definitely would be better with some kind of bottom to it, like a cornmeal crust. still, gruyere and apples can never be anything but pretty delicious. <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> then, tonight i made some delicious [cornmeal muffins][10]. i also want to make some cookies tonight for a bake sale at school on tuesday, more cooking!

in spinning news, a fellow [l.a. guild][11] member is starting a knitty-for-spinners: [Spindlicity][12]! the first issue will be out in december, yay. 

a few weeks ago, i installed tiger, the newest operating system from apple and i&#8217;m having a lot of fun with it. of course, the [widgets][13], oh the widgets! here is my fav, a basic 5 day forecast. aren&#8217;t the images so pretty! and see what monday&#8217;s prediction is? (i love how as the weekend passed, the prediction got decidedly more rainy.) yay ~ bring out the umbrellas and moody music. excellent.
