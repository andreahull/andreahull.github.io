testing testing 1 2 3

if you&#8217;re reading this in your aggregator, please tell me! this morning&#8217;s post hasn&#8217;t turned up in bloglines all day and it&#8217;s making me angry and you don&#8217;t want to see me when i&#8217;m angry (&#224; la [hulk][1])..

i suspect this has to do with my [hosting people][2] (it *may* be me, but &#8216;deny deny deny&#8217; is my motto) &#8212; and i feel like it&#8217;s a happy sign in a way, since i signed up for a sweet (albeit expensive for now) [deal][3] at a [new place][4] just two days ago. 

in the meantime though, testing testing 1 2 3&#8230;

**update:** it&#8217;s fixed! thanks for the &#8216;it&#8217;s working&#8217; comments &#8212; and i realized a post now and then asking about comments, browser behavior, etc is a great way to get your comments-fix for the day &#8212; a new low, i acknowledge that. ..anyhow, i didn&#8217;t do a thing to the feed itself so i&#8217;m not sure what happened nor am i positive it won&#8217;t happen again.
