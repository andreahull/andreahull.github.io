hi~

i am so glad it&#8217;s friday. it totally snuck up on me and i still haven&#8217;t really grasped the fact that tomorrow i can do whatever i want to do, and the same holds for the day *after* tomorrow.

i knew i liked that george michael, he&#8217;s so cool. i&#8217;m a slightly abashed (is that a word?) wham fan and in celebration of his [retirement][1] decision, i sang along to some songs of his this morning in my car on the way to school. i hope more and more singers go this route, agreeing with him that, they &#8220;really don&#8217;t need the public&#8217;s money&#8221; and that they&#8217;ll just provide it for free for people to donwload. and his hope that people downloading will give money to charity is without a doubt great, too.

this just reminds me of a question i think about now and then: how much money is enough? bill gates has more than $40 billion dollars. in the world, there are [over 400][2] people who have a billion dollars or more. that&#8217;s just absurd. but when i try and think about numbers, think well, would i be ok with $10,000? $100,000? $1 million? it&#8217;s gets harder to think straight and figure it out. i remember when i was in kindergarten and we had to say what three wishes we would ask for from a leperchaun and one of mine was for 1000000000000 dollars. i didn&#8217;t put commas or anything, i just knew a lot of zeros was the important part.

enough about dirty moolah. one of my [fav blogs/sites][3], linked to this great resource called the [world wide school library][4]. similar to [project gutenberg][5] (in fact, i think they&#8217;re somehow connected), this site puts online the complete texts of all sorts of books, pamphlets, etc. that either have now passed into the [public domain][6] or that they have the license to publish online. all in all they have a great selection, especially when it comes to children&#8217;s book, fiction in general, and &#8216;social commentary&#8217;..

some great examples: (please note the all-female-ness of it and the progression.. !)
