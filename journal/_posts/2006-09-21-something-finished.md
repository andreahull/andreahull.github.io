make that something*s*, because i finally added the zipper to the long-suffering urban aran, my first time doing that, and i t works great. thank goodness the weather, at least at night, is starting to almost be wool-worthy. kinda. not really. but close enough. just did a little mini-photo shoot, so look for that soon. 

for now though, ta-daa! i present my icarus shawl.
