hi there, i&#8217;ve been so busy at work getting ready for our annual fund drive that my fingers are starting to get cold again, not a fun sign.

<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail id="28" poplink="1" /></span>but, in happy knitting news, i finished the front and back of my pretty inca cotton sweater, ran out of yarn, and am now impatiently waiting for two more skeins to arrive at my door. i really only needed one skein, but the yarn is just so gorgeous to both look at and knit with, i couldn&#8217;t help it.

anyhow regarding these photos, i&#8217;m almost done with this project for a secret someone. can you guess what it is? thank goodness the pattern instructions include some photos because if not i&#8217;d have been scratching my head for hours. the bottom photo is just mama cat looking darn cute in the window (and isn&#8217;t my curtain pretty? <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" />

<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail id="29" poplink="1" /></span>so far it&#8217;s turning out really well (i love seed stitch!) but there&#8217;s still some work to do.. i want to get this surprise gift out in the mail tomorrow if at all possible so i&#8217;ve a bunch to do. the yarn is debbie bliss wool/cotton and so far it&#8217;s been great, and so soft, which is key. i&#8217;m a little worried about how my grubby dirty hands might have changed the color a tad so i will definitely wash and block before i send it off. 

in other news, i recieved a totally bogus &#8216;pay or leave within three days&#8217; notice from the (new) owners of the building i live in. they say they&#8217;re missing rent from, get this, september! that&#8217;s right, two months ago. the idiots don&#8217;t realize i have a reciept from the previous manager saying she had recieved my sepetember rent, and of course, i also have records from my bank saying the check was cashed. it seems they put similar notices on a lot of people&#8217;s doors, i guess to try and scare us off so they could get new renters at a much higher price. ah, but they don&#8217;t know who they&#8217;re messing with, do they? grrrr.
