for a while now, i&#8217;ve been slacking dreadfully with school and though i&#8217;m pretty sure i can pass all right, i don&#8217;t want to &#8211; the whole point of this is to *learn*. so, i might have to ease off with the knitting *and* the website for a while. or at least limit it a bit. 

ah, we&#8217;ll see. i always get nervous monday nights because tuesday is my school day, from 9 am till 5 pm, and i always feel like i&#8217;m super-unprepared. but then, by 3 o&#8217;clock tuesday afternoon, i&#8217;m just bursting with pride, feeling all accomplished school-wise, so :shrug: maybe i&#8217;m just a drama queen. (nahhh!)

just to remind myself that i like, and want, to do other craftsy stuff, i recently signed up for [gifty][1], a gift exchange similar to secret pal but not just for knitters. also, as far as i understand it, it&#8217;s a one-time thing, not three months long. there isn&#8217;t a date yet but i&#8217;m looking forward to it&#8212;maybe i&#8217;ll [cardweave][2] something..

i couldn&#8217;t resist buying some stuff online tonight&#8212;or at least i hope i bought some. [girl from auntie][3], she of the rightfully-famous [rogue][4] pattern, is de-stashing first-come-first-serve. i sent off an email for the gorgeous lush and wool belle vallee. so cheap! there&#8217;s some gorgous lopi wool to knit up a banff&#8212;but i know that blue would feel too peppy for me. 

tonight i re-swatched for topsecret and size 11s worked perfectly; also knit up a 4&#215;4&#8221; square on 10 1/2s to see what effect, if any, blocking would have. stay tuned&#8230;.

also, i started some socks. these would be my first ever &#8211; not the prettiest colors but i&#8217;m sure i&#8217;ll be as proud as a brand new mama when they&#8217;re done (geez, i&#8217;m always jumping the gun!) and yes, i swatched &#8211; i&#8217;ll be watching that tricky gauge of mine verrrry closely. 

lastly, two non-knitting-related items:

this article is so smart &#8211; while re-reading it, i always just shake my head at the common sense widsom in it: [In Search of an Emotionally Healthy Library][5]

and, this book, considered by many to be *the* best intro book on information architecture, is now available online in its complete format, yay: [Infomation Architecture for the World Wide Web][6]

happy tuesday ~ hope everyone has a gorgeously happy day.
