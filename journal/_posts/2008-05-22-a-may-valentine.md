my dad, son of a farmer, set up a small orchard in the back a handful of years ago and he&#8217;d told me that he&#8217;d planted some strawberries in one of the corners of the orchard. i wasn&#8217;t surprised, he&#8217;s such a berry fanatic. (he&#8217;ll buy forty pints of blueberries in the fall and freeze them for his morning cereal throughout winter.) he didn&#8217;t tend the orchard much last year &#8211; my parents were busy traveling to bolivia a lot on various projects &#8211; and this year i&#8217;ve done a teensy bit of pruning here and there, but really it&#8217;s been kinda neglected. however, today, after a nice couple of hours puttering around in the back, i decided to go peek around.

see what i found? the perfect strawberry. the first of my dad&#8217;s harvest, from all those years of working the soil, caring for the plants. i carried it back to the house, proudly showed it to him, he looked at it, said wow, and ate it in two bites. a little red valentine, from the land he loves.

and me? trying to follow in big footsteps. here&#8217;s some pics of my first try..

happy may ~ ~
