hi, i&#8217;m andrea hull. a moody, vegetarian, polyglot, pisces, 27 year old, middle child, introvert, 5&#8217;3&#8221; bibliophile.

i&#8217;m also a grad student at the [department of information studies][1] at [ucla][2]. i&#8217;m taking it slowly and thinking of graduating not within the normal two year, but maybe two and a half years. now that our new governor has passed a bill augmenting graduate fees for next year by 20%, i&#8217;m not so sure.

since november 2002 i&#8217;ve been working at the [pacifica radio archives][3] in different capacities and constantly changing schedules. right now, and really for the last year or so, i&#8217;ve been the unofifical webmaster, doing odds and ends cataloging (especially of [democracy now!][4], pacifica&#8217;s flagship program), as well as a whole lot of researching, organizing and assisting in lots of different projects. i&#8217;m still a temp at the archives ~ and and have alternately been called &#8220;production assistant&#8221;, &#8220;assistant cataloger&#8221; and credited with &#8220;web design&#8221;. hmpfh.

when not working or at school, you&#8217;ll find me home sweet home! home is a teeny apartment in koreatown with a loud street just outside my windows, bad pipes, and faulty electricity, but i love it. home is also sometimes maryland, just a few miles from the potomac river (that&#8217;s where i grew up and all my family is still there).

i used to be pretty involved in activist stuff, but since starting school this past year, and even before, once i moved into this apartment by myself, i pretty much dropped all the other groups and meetings. i feel a little guilty sometimes but mostly i&#8217;m glad to be done with the tedious meetings, annoying pontificating jerks, paranoia, socially-inbred cliques, and overall failure to really accomplish anything (the one exception: [la food not bombs][5]).

i love to read, eat carbs and grease, shower, play with my cats, dress up, go to sleep, play with little kids, make stuff, and laugh. i&#8217;m not very good at being happy on a regular basis, expressing myself beyond simplicities, reading non-fiction, keeping to to-do lists, excercising regularly, keeping in touch, or keeping my temper. i&#8217;m also a pretty agressive driver, i&#8217;m afraid ~ all my repressed anger just bubbles up and i start cussing and feeling really competitive. also, i always have lots of library fines and am overall a pretty dirty person. but, though this may seem a contradiction, i think i am getting better and better all the time (knock on wood). 

a great philosophy: &#8220;first, do no harm.&#8221; 

mini-colophon(ish):

hard & software

  * &#187; [a mac 15&#8221; powerbook][6]
  * &#187; [bbedit][7]
  * &#187; [kodak easyshare cx6330][8]

applications & code bits

  * &#187; [oddbook][9]
  * &#187; [gallery][10]
  * &#187; [hiveware&#8217;s image rotator][11]

web help

  * &#187; [w3schools][12] & [html goodies][13]
  * &#187; all the webdesign, css, ia, etc. links found on my [links page][14]
  * &#187; and just for fun, [favicon][15] tutorial, using photoshop

putting it all together

  * &#187; now i use the excellent [textpattern][16], but before i tried &#8216;rolling my own&#8217; so to speak, and did pretty nicely if i may say so myself, using the following:
  * &#187; [atomz][17], for free searching
  * &#187; for commenting, first i tried [symbio][18] (commenting cgi script &#8211; it&#8217;s great and open source!) but it was a little overkill for me, so i set up [dotcomments][19], which worked fine and needs no sql databases or weird cgi-stuff, i.e. it&#8217;s very easy (and fully customizable)!
