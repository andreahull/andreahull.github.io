## by Karen Cushman 

quick good read &#8211; isn&#8217;t all gooshy and unreaslistic about the middle ages, but definitely is smart and funny.

also, i like how detailed the book gets in describing the work of bonesetters in the middle ages, as well as the general atmosphere of that time period. there&#8217;s also a bibliography at the end for those who want to read more about what it was like living in those time.

one interesting and gory fact cushman offers us: the traditional barber&#8217;s pole (that i always thought looked so jolly) dates in fact from the days when the barber was the all-around cutter, both of hair as well as any limbs that needed amputating. so, the barber would advertise his presence by hanging on a pole outside his workplace bloody rags. 

yay for history! gulp.
