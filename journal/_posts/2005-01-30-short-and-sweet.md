hi secret pal! here&#8217;s my [questionnaire][1]. <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" />

and to everyone else, i need some help! i&#8217;m starting knitty&#8217;s [topsecret][2] (i am determined to make a sweater that is comfy and big on me!) but i&#8217;m immediately thrown off by the gauge. it says &#8216;*12 sts = 4&#8221; over st st using size 10.5 needles*&#8217;. ok, that&#8217;s 12 stitches horizontally, which hallelujah, i *do* get on 10 1/2s, but what about row-wise/vertically? 

also, if you made this, what size did you make &#8211; do you wish you&#8217;d gone up or down a size? 

i must report that yesterday i walked into a gorgeous local yarn store (with usually a snobby staff, but yesterday someone actually came up and asked me if i needed help and seemed really sweet; oh and tracy ullman was in there buying all this beautiful $$ yarn!) and *walked out* without buying a thing. i was pretty cranky for the next hour or so but it still counts as quite an accomplishment. (sad, really.)

it&#8217;s a beautiful sunny day and my apartment is a **mess**. so, off to do laundry and some mopping (yuck).
