<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="925" /></span>general forecast: as of friday, that&#8217;s what i am, unemployed. people at work/school, kept asking me, well what&#8217;s the plan then? and i&#8217;d just grin and say nothing, nada, zip. for this first week at least, i plan to veg &#8211; get out silly movies from the library, spin like a mad woman, cook a lot, go sightseeing on the bus for hours, read a ton of books, and sleep sleep sleep. 

<span class="picl"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="926" /></span>specific forecast: today has been a jumble of ideas, feelings, pacing, exclaiming, worrying and so on &#8211; i hope the next two months aren&#8217;t this hectic. anyhow, something big is happening today, i&#8217;m holding my breath and crossing my fingers &#8211; will you do the same? i&#8217;ll explain what it&#8217;s all about tomorrow, promise, but for today, no jinxing allowed. just happy thoughts sent my way, please, and i&#8217;ll pass them on to where it&#8217;s very much needed.

<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="927" /></span>ok, after all, some spinning &#8211; my first time with two new fibers: pygora and flax. the pygora was one of the quickest spins i&#8217;ve ever done, it practically spun itself. there was only an ounce of it, so at 2-ply, that means 47 yards, but still, what a dream! (oh, and the drink in that pic isn&#8217;t milk, it&#8217;s [horchata][1] &#8211; gotta love l.a., the only place i know of where they sell horchata right next to the orange juice and whole milk, yay.) 

<span class="picl"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="928" /></span>the minute flax gets spun into yarn, it&#8217;s no longer flax but linen. lovely, with 252 yards of it, made up of singles that were pretty darn balanced. it took about four hours to spin, seeing as how i have no distaff, which would have helped tremendously, and that i had to wet each strand as it went (to strengthen the fiber and smooth it down as well, give it a try). after spinning, as you can see, i boiled it for about an hour which did indeed soften it up just a tad. i absolutely love that this came from a plant, and i&#8217;m just itching to try nettles. hm. 

p.s. you did hear the [croc hunter][2] died, right? <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" /> absolutely sucks.
