<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="86" /></span>it&#8217;s 7:30 in the morning. i have class at 9 but am seriously considering just skipping it. i haven&#8217;t finished the assignment due, it&#8217;s almost an hour drive to get there (though only 12 miles away. grrr, i hate l.a. traffic), i&#8217;m exhausted (we had an open house reception at work last night so i worked 12 hours yesterday, ugh), i&#8217;m underslept (for days and days now), after class, i&#8217;ll have to rush like crazy to get to work on time at 1 pm, and also trouble is sitting very sweetly on my lap purring like a sweetie. all the signs point to skipping this class. 

it&#8217;s my reference class and today we&#8217;re learning about [dialog][1]. a nice friend at school lent me her notes so i&#8217;ve got a copy of all the handouts, etc and my assignment will be turned in late, so what. the teacher for this class gives extra credit on all kinds of stuff (yes, i *am* in grad school) so it shouldn&#8217;t matter. ok, yup. with all this i&#8217;ve convinced myself. i&#8217;m not going. 

this way, i can sleep till noon and then leisurely wake up and drive myself to work, maybe even stopping and returning some library books, depositing my paycheck, etc. what i really really want to do right now is buy some yarn, rent some movies, and just be left alone till i fall asleep and sleep for a good twelve hours straight. but i can&#8217;t miss work, i need the pay &#8211; and anyway, a nap will do me much good but 12 hours of sleep in the middle of the day will make me depressed.

i am determined to *not* spend the next 4 hours on the internet just [b][2][r][3][o][4][w][5][s][6][i]()[n][7][g][8] like i did last night till 2 am. determined. as soon as i&#8217;m done with this post, i&#8217;m closing the laptop, setting the alarm, and going to sleep. i need very badly to have energy for the things i want to do &#8211; not just for work and school. i still haven&#8217;t even unpacked from the holidays yet, it&#8217;s just sitting there in the middle of the room with a growing pile of laundry surrounding it. fffffffff.

in a slump & on strike,

[btw, a friend found the pic online &#8211; makes me smile to see it, thought i&#8217;d share]
