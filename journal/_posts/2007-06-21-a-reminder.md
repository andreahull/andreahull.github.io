this video has been inspiring me for days now &#8211; the singing, the dancing, the audience, [the words][1], and just the amazing energy. yay!

it&#8217;s almost as amazing to realize that this band is from d.c.! as in the city not thirty miles away from my bedroom. every time i *do* go into the city &#8211; actually get out of my car and walk around &#8211; i get such a good vibe. this city has produced some pretty great things, particularly when it comes to music. it&#8217;s such a small city, especially in comparison with l.a., but it&#8217;s chock-full of different neighborhoods, atmospheres, scenes, and people. ok, next time i&#8217;m chatting with new friends about going out dancing or going to some show, i gotta remember this video and just go for it. i gotta give it a chance, you know?, because i have a feeling i could learn a whole lot. 

happy first day of summer ~
