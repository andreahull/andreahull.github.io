    <h2>
      by Neil Gaiman

      towards the end, i had the vague feeling that i&#8217;d read the book before and had forgotten about it until then. i&#8217;m still not sure &#8211; after all, it&#8217;s a fairy tale that i probably read before, and not necessarily this version by gaiman, but still a bit frustrating. a good story &#8211; i like how it bends and twists, though many parts were really predictable.

      the illustrations were offputting, mostly &#8211; just not my style. but they stuck in my head, forcing my brain to use <em>this</em> image of tristan instead of imagining one, etc etc. hmph. don&#8217;t like that.

      again, neil gaiman &#8211; interesting, some good parts, but overall i&#8217;m not super-impressed. what am i not getting about him that makes others just adore him?
