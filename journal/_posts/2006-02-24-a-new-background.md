<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="808" /></span>i love the different colors of wood, and in my apartment there&#8217;s a couple different types that really appeal. since you all have seen only the table &#8211; again and again, in every photo it seems <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> &#8211; i thought, hey i like this floor, let&#8217;s just take a pic there. so, yup, my pretty (dusty) floor. also, a nice sideline view of what all old buildings in l.a. have, that is, long metal bars for earthquake proofing, supposedly. and see all those cracks between the boards? a total haven for crumbs and kitty litter &#8211; what a lovely combo. 

the most important part is the yarn, of course. a little treat from me to me (there will be many of those this coming month!) via [nordic fiber arts][1]. i loved knitting my [flenten hat][2], and really enjoyed the whole fair isle process. so, on to #2 for the [norwegian knit-along][3]. aren&#8217;t the colors lovely? oh, it&#8217;s a bag featured in the [summer 2004 IK][4]. 

<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="809" /></span>as for the lace leaf pullover, i&#8217;m a bit stymied, but taking it in stride. [grafting][5] was interesting and i think my results were pretty good. seaming is usually fun but for some reason, after that first sleeve, i&#8217;m putting off the second. one thing i do know, it fits, and it actually fits big, which is what i wanted. i like little tops, but i&#8217;ve been really wanting to knit a comfy sweater for a while, so this totally fits the ticket. 

randomness: i got a cellphone! a pre-paid cheapy thing, but i like it a lot, plus i have a crickets chirping ringtone which is every so soothing and fun. next, i&#8217;ve [read][6] that carbohydrates trigger the release of seratonin, which has a calming effect, so bring on the potatoes! 

i&#8217;ve kind of lost track of things this past week &#8211; i was all excercising, and eating healthy, and on top of work, and this week, as par course when the quarter is nearing its end, i let it all just go flppppp. old habits returning, hard-won changes disintigrating. so, last night was my indulging watch-tv-and-barely-move time whereas today so far has been Productive. cross you fingers for me, please. i&#8217;m turning 29 in a week and i feel very un-adultish. what i want for my birthday this year is Stability. is that at **all** possible? you tell me.

nonetheless, happy weekend ~ 

*a new overall background coming up march 1st to celebrate the first month of [project spectrum][7]. be very excited.
