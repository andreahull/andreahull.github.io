<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="932" /></span>thanks for all the comments on that last post ~ i&#8217;m sending my brother the link today and i&#8217;m sure he&#8217;ll be pleased as punch. so far, so good: he&#8217;s home now and happy to be out of the hospital and scott is doing well too, though will be at john hopkins for a while yet.

and what&#8217;s this? knitting? yes indeed. i have twenty-two rows to go before binding off, but with each row taking a good twenty minutes (and i [read][1] that the bind-off is a bit of a bother), it&#8217;ll be a week or so until icarus is done. at least i&#8217;m at the fun part with the feathers and such &#8211; plus i&#8217;m thinking about adding the beads [the designer][2] mentioned. so, make that two weeks. <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> no rush, i&#8217;m enjoying it for now. <span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="933" /></span>

and that in the corner, what&#8217;s that? my happy sourdough starter i got from a friend&#8217;s boyfriend a while back. i&#8217;m planning on making some homemade [sourdough bread][3] tomorrow. can&#8217;t wait.

other than that, i&#8217;m keeping on keeping on, you know? hope you are too. i almost always have good intentions about posting more often, but there&#8217;s so much coming up this week and so much happened this past week that i absolutely *must* post more and soon.
