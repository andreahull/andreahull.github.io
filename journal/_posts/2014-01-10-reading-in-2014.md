hello! 

i won&#8217;t even pretend that i&#8217;ll post here again soon, much less catch you &#8211; whoever you are <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> &#8211; up on what&#8217;s been going on in my life. in a way, these infrequent posts over the past handful of years (!) prove to me that this site is what i always thought it was, albeit sometimes getting caught up in other ideas for it: a place for me to put ideas or notes or whatever that i want to access in the future. that&#8217;s it. it&#8217;s not for creating a following, making money, or even really informing others on things i know. i mean, if people follow a link i post and learn something, yay for that, but it&#8217;s not my goal at all. i keep up with family and friends in other ways, including digital ways, so this site here is now very simply just for me &#8211; and if it&#8217;s interesting to you too, then welcome. <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> 

anyhow, to sum up the last handful of months: i was pregnant, had a second baby girl who is currently hiccuping on my chest as she tries to nap, oh and we moved days before she was born, and i finally got my double citizenship papers all done and just yesterday received my national id card. so, we&#8217;re really doing it &#8211; the whole living-in-bolivia-for-ever(ish) with kidS and all that. oh and we&#8217;re building a house too! exciting times. **busy** times. a lot of my personal interests have been largely put on hold temporarily and sometimes they still insisted on nagging me. 

this year though, hello 2014, even with a newborn and toddler to wrestle, i&#8217;m determined to make a little more time for them, especially books. oh books, i miss you! it&#8217;s mostly ebooks nowadays, at least until bookdepository.com starts free shipping to bolivia at least. <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" /> so, last year i read a grand total of&#8230; wait for it.. 23 books. twenty-three!! that&#8217;s pathetic. my goal was 100. in 2012, i read over 70. anyway, at least they were almost all good books, and a handful were great to boot. i was thinking about not having a reading goal this year, but once again, the shiny widgets of goodreads tempted me and before i knew it i had committed to reading 52 books this year. but i also want to add two additional challenges: 1) read 12 non-fiction science books, and 2) read 12 books in spanish. now, for #2, those books do not have to be adult books, and in fact most of them will be middle grade books, and that is ok by me. it&#8217;s hard for me to read in spanish &#8211; i&#8217;m so darn sllllooowww and it drives me crazy. i&#8217;m faster if i read out loud but that gets old quick. 

i&#8217;m going to try and post here when i start or finish new books each week or month as the case may be, in hopes of posting more. because clearly, whenever i **do** post, i babble away for paragraphs, long paragraphs! i&#8217;m currently halfway through [Hild][1] by Niccola Griffith and it&#8217;s [as great as promised][2]. for the spanish challenge, i&#8217;m considering [Uma y el tren a las estrella][3]s by Mariana Ruiz Romero -here&#8217;s [a short youtube video][4] based on it, done by illustrators of the book i believe. and then for the science challenge, i&#8217;m eyeing [ Periodic Tales: The Curious Lives of the Elements][5] by Hugh Aldersey-Williams, [Forests: The Shadow of Civilization][6] by Robert Pogue Harrison, or [Here On Earth: A Natural History of the Planet][7] by Tim Flannery.
