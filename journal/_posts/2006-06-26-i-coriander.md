      i&#8217;d been keeping my eye out for this book a while now and was happy to stumble upon in it in the still-new westwood branch of l.a.p.l. &#8211; it&#8217;s funny how despite the adage, it general you can still totally judge a book by its cover. shoot, sometimes i can just tell a book will be good by the font chosen, or even just the spine standing there were so many other spines.

      so yeah, good book &#8211; a little bit borrowed from the general cinderella story, enough so to make it interesting, but not enough to make it predictable. i still have some questions about the ending, but i like that &#8211; neatly tied-up endings are furstrating and unreal.
