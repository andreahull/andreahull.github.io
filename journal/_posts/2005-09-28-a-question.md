hello ~

i finished <span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="691" /></span>the back of the &#8220;open rib/cable pullover&#8221; (such a charming name, vogue knitting!) and realized that i almost probably definitely will *not* have enough yarn. at least not of the same color. 

see, i bought this yarn on sale, just a few balls, one day, and then a week later, realized i loved the yarn, could do great things with it, went back and was able to find another nine balls &#8211; after pushing through, and ultimately stacking up (!) all the balls in the various sale bins &#8211; making a grand total of 14 sunsette plymouth balls in this lovely purple you see here. just because i was nervous, i got two more, in a light brown. (btw, the top pic shows the true color a bit better &#8211; i love this natural light, but it&#8217;s a tad strong and kinda washed out the bottom pic..)

hmm.<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="693" /></span> the pattern calls for 12 balls of dale&#8217;s svale, which at 114 yards, equals 1,368 yards needed. the plymouth sunsette, on the other hand, has only 88 yards. i have 14 balls of it in purple, and 2 more in a light brown, so 14 balls equals 1, 232 yards and 16 = 1, 408. 

the question, therefore, is, so i have enough yarn, but how to divy up the colors? easily, the neckline can be in the light brown. but is that enough? if not, what about the sleeves color-wise? i could also shorten the sleeves, but i rather like the length of them as is. 

and yup, i&#8217;ve looked around online but haven&#8217;t been able to find plymouth&#8217;s sunsette in this lovely shade (color 2885) anywhere. sigh.

help!

p.s. i&#8217;m happy to see i&#8217;m [not the only one][1] [who swoons over this yarn][2] &#8211; what&#8217;s not to love? it&#8217;s a slightly shimmery super-soft yarn that loves cables. looks like plymouth has gotten rid of the line though, can&#8217;t find any mention of it on their website.
