pattern: from [knitty][1], by [vanessa carter][2]  
yarn: 1/4 skein of heather worsted-weight wool (no tag) and a yard or two of leftover cascade 220  
needles: size 3 dpns

as soon as i saw this pattern, i knew i would be knitting one up asap. it&#8217;s perfect for leftover yarn and it has just enough changes in it to make it interesting but not too many that you&#8217;re always squinting at the pattern. 

this is the first &#8220;thing&#8221; i&#8217;ve made since my seventh grade &#8220;pillow friend&#8221; (a home economics class final &#8211; and disaster) and i&#8217;m pretty pleased with how he turned out. the stuffing was a little tricky and in some places i could&#8217;ve definitely added more &#8211; i love the pooch the original bubby has. 

as for ends, i was worried, but really there were only eight or so &#8211; and i didn&#8217;t even try weaving them in, just pulled them through the body and just snipped. maybe dangerous, but shoot, i like living on the edge, you know? <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" />

this little guy is going out in the mail today, all the way to the east coast to, hopefully, make my niece kiyra giggle a bunch.
