      one of the best books i&#8217;ve read in a long long time. so great! i&#8217;m hoping the author writes more -whether about mimus or others &#8211; so soon. it was the kind of book where after i finished reading i just kept patting the cover and sighing &#8211; yup, that good. taking place in a medieval world, it&#8217;s the story of florin, the hostage prince who has been forced to become the apprentice to the new king&#8217;s jester.

      the cover illustration is perfect &#8211; it really conveys the atmosphere and focus of the book, which at times you might think is florin, but in reality is a commentary on outsiders, an old (thiry-something! <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> ) wise man, and the ridiculousness of revenge and war.
