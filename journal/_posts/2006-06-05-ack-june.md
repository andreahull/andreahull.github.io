<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="870" /></span>hey there ~ i cannot believe 2006 is almost halfway over already. lots to report, but for now the smaller catch-ups and links i&#8217;ve been collection, thinking about, occupied with for the last week or so..

~ lots of nice new patterns in the online knitting world: [prosperous plum tank][1], [ms. marigold][2], and [licorice whip][3] [via [kris][4], [rose][5], and someone else i can&#8217;t remember, sorry!]

~ somewhat an old story by now, but did you hear this: &#8220;GM plans to cap petrol prices at $1.99 a gallon for buyers of certain 2006 and 2007 <span class="caps">SUV</span> and mid-size cars.&#8221; which ones? &#8220;the Chevrolet Tahoe and Suburban, the <span class="caps">GMC</span> Yukon and Yukon XL and the Hummer H2 and H3.&#8221; unbelievable. a giant fuck you to the world, don&#8217;t you think? &#8211; more [here][6] 

~ for fantasy and sci-fi geeks like me, [this][7] is exciting and also worrisome: &#8220;Anne McCaffrey&#8217;s best-selling and long-running SF book series The Dragonriders of Pern will be adapted for the big screen&#8221;

~ [bike metro][8] is a handy web site that will find and calculate the distance, time, and, get this, *incline* of a bike route between two destinations in southern california. no bike yet, but this makes it tempting. [via [janice][9]]

<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="871" /></span>~ [watch][10] mr. rogers defend pbs in 1969 to a initially skeptical senator who then does a comple 180 and declares mr. rogers just saved pbs funding. it&#8217;s a really earnest and heartfelt little clip &#8211; check it out.

~ [francesca][11] has been posting some gorgeous pics of fair isle (like [here][12] and [here][13]), so of course the fair isle bug is starting to bite again. before knitting, i would *never* have worn something like [this][14], but now i think it&#8217;s lovely. sigh?

~ what else.. i&#8217;ve been watching a bunch of [movies][15] and doing even more pleasure [reading][16]. my fav of the bunch is mimus by lilli thal &#8211; what an excellent book. also, for the librarians out there, my second-to-last [school project][17] evah: &#8220;Serving the Needs of Blind and Print-Challenged Library Users.&#8221; 

~ two articles on farmer&#8217;s markets. the [first][18] is a history of farmer&#8217;s markets in southern california, with the first set up in gardena, a bit of a surprise. the [second][19] article, entitled &#8216;farmer&#8217;s markets go beyond green&#8217; tells about a new farmer&#8217;s market in new york that will allow things to be sold that are not grown by the farmers selling at the market &#8211; a key principle, duh, in farmer&#8217;s markets. the director of this new market says, &#8220;I think the farmers&#8217; market movement has failed consumers in not making it possible to buy everything they need for Saturday night dinner. It&#8217;s time to be more inclusive.&#8221; um, excuse me? she&#8217;s missing the entire point of a farmer&#8217;s market, in my opinion. ugh. [via [megnut][20]]

~ also, i haven&#8217;t read it yet, but check out *time*&#8216;s coverage of eating locally, [the lure of the 100-mile diet][21]. there&#8217;s also a michael pollan [essay][22] and a bunch of [other food-related][23] stories (&#8230; that same issue&#8217;s cover story is about [haditha][24] ) 

i think i&#8217;ll be doing some seaming this weekend &#8211; yup, a 100% wool cardigan just in time for the 90+ degree weather we&#8217;re seeing here in l.a., lovely. <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" />

p.s. pics &#8211; the first is obvious to those in the know &#8211; or who can read the print in the photo <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> -, but really i haven&#8217;t done a thing past that first part. more on all that later, for sure. the second pic is of a delicious vegan sloppy joe &#8211; perfect for a mid-day snack. gotta love [finger food][25].
