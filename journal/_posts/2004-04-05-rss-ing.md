layout: post

hi. i know, this post is [supposed][1] to be about [f][2][o][3]o[d][4], but i didn&#8217;t feel like it yesterday and this morning i woke up early (7 am!) and couldn&#8217;t go back to sleep and just a felt a hankering for some <acronym title="really simple syndication / rich site summary">rss</acronym> research.</p> 

so, on this first day of classes for me, i present some good links to those wondering the hows, why, wheres of syndication:

Â» [looking for the perfect rss][5]  
Â» [an excerise in clarity: rss in ten words or less][6]  
Â» [what is rss?][7]  
Â» [dive into xml][8]  
Â» [history of the rss fork][9]  
Â» [why choose rss 1.0?][10]  
Â» [atom wiki][11]  
Â» [misunderstanding xml and other rss follies][12]  
Â» [a long list of rss news/additions][13]

also, my full list of validators:

Â» [(x)html][14]  
Â» [css][15]  
Â» [grammar][16]  
Â» [link check][17]  
Â» [rss validator][18]  
Â» [are you accessible?][19]

in the news: [&#8216;google moves to block rss scraping&#8217;][20].

i think i&#8217;ve decided on using <strike>[atom][21]</strike> [rss 2.0][22], though the librarian in me wants to use [rss 1.0][23] since it uses dublin core metatags. there seems to be a bit of tension between the different camps (are you 0.92? 1.0? atom? grrrr.) thankfully, dave winer, one of the creators of rss, recently [proposed a merger][24] between rss and atom. [or is netscape returning?][25]

*update:ok, i got something up and running for now: <main.xml>. yay!*

i [did end up taking a bunch of pictures at <acronym title="los angeles public library">lapl</acronym>][1] and they&#8217;re up to see on [my gallery][26] page.

feeling dorky and a bit sleepy,

andrea

p.s. kurt cobain died 10 years ago today. it&#8217;s so weird to remember a day ten years (!) before: i was an exchange student in palermo and a rocker boy sadly told me during a break between classes.
