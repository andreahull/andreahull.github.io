hi~

these last two weeks have been really nice for me &#8212; a lot of work but worth it. school starts for me on monday and i&#8217;ve already started some of my readings though i know i&#8217;m at least partially doing that to allay any future guilty feelings when i inevitably don&#8217;t even attempt to do the readings.

i finished reading a good book last night and proudly added it to my [booklist][1]. i&#8217;m so excited about this booklist-thing that i couldn&#8217;t bring myself to read anything, cause i was too afraid to write a review, i just wanted it to be really good. oh well- i don&#8217;t think it is, but i don&#8217;t care, now, thank goodness ;D oh and i&#8217;ve been working on a [future reading list][2] that sooner or later i will (seamlessly :D) incorporate into my [booklist][1]. 

i realized with a shock that the [american libraries assoc][3] is having it&#8217;s midwinter conference in san diego this weekend &#8211; i won a free exhibit pass to it a while back and i was planning on going to it, but dang! there goes my weekend! but right now, 3 pm on saturday, i don&#8217;t think i&#8217;ll be going today, at least. tomorrow there&#8217;s a [progressive librarian&#8217;s guild][4] meeting which i would really love to go to but man! san diego?! i know that&#8217;s not that far, but i literally hoard my private free time and this weekend is **all mine**&#8230; so we&#8217;ll see about tomorrow .. <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" class="wp-smiley" />
