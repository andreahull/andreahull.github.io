**update:** ever since the debate last night, i&#8217;ve been getting hits from people looking for a bit torrent of the presidential debates, since this post here talks about both, though for different reasons. anyways, if you&#8217;re one of those people, here&#8217;s what you&#8217;re looking for: <http://www.lokitorrent.com/torrents-details.php?id=31968> [from [lessig blog][1]; you need to login to lokitorrent, but it&#8217;s free]

hi there, it&#8217;s a sleepy morning on a computer with a squeaky space bar and dreams of cockroaches and unidentifiable long-legged insects. and last night, arriving late at my apartment and finding no legal parking spot after a good ten minute search, i parked in a not-very-good-spot definitely-in-the-red-but-it&#8217;ll-have-to-do and set my alarm clock for seven in the morning so that i could move the car before the meter people started working and could give me a ticket. so, after that very long sentence, you can guess this part: i got the ticket anyway, timestamped at 6:16 in the morning. argh! sixty-five bucks down the drain. &#8230;..ok, moving on. coming up: techie, library and then presidential stuff.

techie stuff first:

i installed this handy little program called [shortstat][2] on my site for better tracking capabilities, since lunarpages doesn&#8217;t believe in awstats, which i used to have and was thus spoiled to ever be able to use webalizer again and since textpattern&#8217;s logging pages, although satisfying on an individual basis, doesn&#8217;t give me an overall view of the month, much less week&#8217;s stats. i also tweaked the script a bit thanks to [nomadig][3] ([here][4], too) and [thewatchmakerproject][5] , as well as [hicks][6] on using shortstat with textpattern. [give it a gander][7]. i especially like the country box, very fun. 

oh, and i&#8217;m discovering the joys (and headaches) of [bit torrent][8].

hopefully not related, i got my first mac virus this weekend. i was typing and all of a sudden the screen had a few lines of black at the top with all this gobbledy text and then haltingly my entire desktop started moving down off the screen leaving a black nothing at the top. freaked out, i flipped the laptop over, unplugged it from the power and popped out the battery. then i immediately installed norton&#8217;s systemworks while bemoaning my loss of mac-smugness. seems like nothing got deleted or messed with and now i have weekly updates, etc. with norton. eek. 

library stuff:

i think this might be the quarter of Alluring Public Librarianship. not only will i be not taking a single informatics or archives class, but two out of three classes are strictly involving the (gasp) masses that use the library. not only that, but the [calif. library assoc.][9]&#8217;s annual conference is looking mighty spiffy, with not only the esteemable [walt crawford][10] of *cites & insights* fame but also the [mysterious lemony snickett][11]. so how can i not go?! and the workshops are deliciously not archives at all: &#8216;bilingual storytime? me?&#8217;, &#8216;setting up your library&#8217;s blog&#8217; (they better mention [blogwithoutalibrary.net][12] or i will), &#8216;has the dmca left us any fair use issues? can libraries be liable for file sharing&#8217;, &#8216;dragons, deed, and daring deeds @ your library&#8217;, etc etc. [the mad librarian][13] has come up with a list of helpful hints for the newbie conference goes (well, it was created for ala, but i&#8217;m sure some of it applies to cla as well).

for my kid&#8217;s lit class (which i&#8217;m getting more and more excited about), we **have** to read harry potter. (book one, i believe). now, that&#8217;s exactly why being a librarian appealed to me when i was ten or so. and, it still does. 

presidential stuff:

[the presidential debate agreement][14] (pdf) between bush and kerry states:

  * ~ parties agree not to issue challenges to additional debates while debating
  * ~ parties agree not to appear in any other debate or adversarial forum with other presidential candidates
  * ~ topic of the sept 30th debate: foreign policy and homeland security
  * ~ topic of the oct 13th debate: economic and domestic policy
  * ~ the oct 8th debate: not limited to any topic
  * ~ no props, charts, notes or diagrams are allowed
  * ~ candidates may however take notes &#8220;on the size, type, and color of paper each prefers and using the type of pen or pencil that each prefers&#8221; *****
  * ~ &#8220;the candidates may not ask each other direct questions, but they may ask rhetorical questions&#8221;
  * ~ numerous coin tosses will determine much, including who first gives the opening and closing statments, who get to choose stage/podium positioning, etc etc ad nauseum
  * ~ &#8220;the commission shall use best efforts to maintain an appropriate temperature&#8221; (makes me wonder if there&#8217;s a history of broken a/c at these things..)
  * ~ &#8220;each candidate may use his own makeup person&#8221;
  * ~ risers or anything used &#8220;to create an impression of elevated height&#8221; are not allowed (tell me, are they really going to check w&#8217;s shoes?)
  * ~ at different debates the following will be used: podiums & no seating devices allowed, swivel chairs at a table with the moderator, and stools (very important stuff here, folks)

(*****too funny: &#8220;each candidate must submit to the staff of the commission prior to the debate all such paper and any pens or pencils&#8221; &#8211; reminds me of taking the sat in high school, to make sure we weren&#8217;t cheating. ha.)
