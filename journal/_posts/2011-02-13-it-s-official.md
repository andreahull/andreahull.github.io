i’m bolivian! i feel super lucky. i love this country so.

oh and i’m not giving up my u.s. citizenship either, dual citizenship is a great thing. <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" />

note: it only took 10 months to get to this one piece of paper. and that’s with me reaaally being slow about it this summer and fall. if i had to do it again (yay, i don’t!), i could do it in two months i’m guessing.
