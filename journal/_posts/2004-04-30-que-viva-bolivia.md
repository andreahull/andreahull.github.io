happy friday, everyone.

lots of scary stuff happening around bolivia recently and since i love! [that][1] [country][2] [so][3] [much][4] i&#8217;m just going to write about recent events concerning bolivia, even though [walt crawford&#8217;s recent cites and insights][5] is a great great read and [fatal harvest][6] is a book i always wanted to buy but can&#8217;t justify budget-wise, and all kinds of other stuff i wanted to write about, [happy][7] , [sad][8], [really sad][9], and [shame][10][ful][11]. but bolivia is just **not** talked about in the news practically ever, and rarely in any kind of depth whatsoever. it&#8217;s ridiculous.

first off, i got this link in a an email from vacya, there&#8217;s this [scary san francisco chronicle article][12]. General James Hill, head of U.S. Southern Command, recently told a congressional panel that &#8220;the threats to the U.S. are twofold: &#8216;traditional&#8217; terrorists [guerrillas, drug traffickers];

and <span style="font-weight: 500">&#8216;emerging&#8217; terrorists: &#8220;radical populists&#8221; who tap into &#8220;deep-seated frustrations of the failure of democratic reforms to deliver expected goods and services.&#8221;</span> Hill&#8217;s apparent reference is to Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez and Bolivian indigenous leader Evo Morales.&#8221; of course, &#8220;in the post-9/11 world, when the U.S. military defines itself in relation to the war on terror, Southcom is the odd man out.&#8221; &#8216;emerging terrorists&#8217;?! red-baiting of the 21st century, anyone? if it weren&#8217;t so sad, and if i weren&#8217;t afraid of getting beat up, i would make a shirt saying &#8216;emerging terrorist&#8217; and wear it everywhere.

with this in mind, i poked around for other recent news on bolivia and came up with a whole slew of alarming news. a few days ago, the excellent [narco news][13] published an article [detailing an aborted military coup d&#8217;etat][14] that was to have happened april 25th. evo morales, the *cocaleros* leader, first released the details of this would-be coup. a few days later, the bolivian president carlos mesa [admitted a coup had been planned][15]. also, recently, the bolivian gov&#8217;t gave in to the u.s. who [wants to build two u.s. military bases in bolivia][16]. as if the u.s. would ever every let another country build a military base in the u.s&#8230; 

but of course the u.s. has [hundreds of bases][17] all over the world. then,[coca in bolivia][18] is an old tradition that forms a big part of indigenous culture (indigenous people make up at least 60% of the population) so [erradication is not an option][19]. when the u.s. continues to assault the whole idea of coca and coca-growing, [how can bolivians *not* react][20]? lastly, u.s. embassy-evil-man david greenlee is also pressuring mesa [for immunity][21] for u.s. military in bolivia. incredible.

p.s. yeah, the whole [sinclair][22]-[nightline][23] thing is [out][24][rageous][25]. 

p.s.2 i love [this feminist(e) blog][26].
