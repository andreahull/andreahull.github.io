so said columbus, on meeting the arawak indians. how disgraceful that this man, and what he began, is celebrated all over the u.s. today. it shows a lot of what this country stands for. ugh.

> &#8220;..But too many of the slaves died in captivity. And so Columbus, desperate to pay back dividends to those who had invested, had to make good his promise to fill the ships with gold. In the province of Cicao on Haiti, where he and his men imagined huge gold fields to exist, they ordered all persons fourteen years or older to collect a certain quantity of gold every three months. When they brought it, they were given copper tokens to hang around their necks. Indians found without a copper token had their hands cut off and bled to death.&#8221; &#8211; [an excerpt][1] from howard zinn&#8217;s *a people&#8217;s history of the united states*
