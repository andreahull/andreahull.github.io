## by Elizabeth Wayland Barber 

this was a great book i read a few years ago, when i was first getting interested in fiber arts, especially weaving, at that time. barber&#8217;s writing is detailed without weighing you down in the slightest bit &#8211; though an academic, she does *not*, thank goodness, write like one (or at least, like most of them) and instead makes this book not only inspiring to read but also very thought-provoking. reading this book will more than likely make you gasp, cry out, shake your head in amazement, and/or smile enormously and sigh with satisfaction.

yes, it&#8217;s that good.
