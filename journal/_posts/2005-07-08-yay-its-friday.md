hi there!

<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="291" /></span>first off, i&#8217;m very happy to announce my computer is fixed! after so much hassle, i believe everything is back to normal, but i&#8217;m holding off on restoring the backedup data for a few days more at least. in the meantime though, this means wireless once again (blogging from my bed is *the best*), watching dvds (saw *far from heaven* last night, [dennis quaid][1] rocks), doing pilates (my powerhouse is in much pain), and most importantly, reading and writing in blogland, yay!

i love love etymology, but can&#8217;t quite [afford][2] a copy of the OED, so i was psyched to hear [via [librarian in black][3]] about the [online etymology dictionary][4]. it seems they&#8217;re taking the definitions from a variety of sources, and they have gaps of course, but i was happy to see their definition of [girl][5]: *c.1290, gyrle &#8220;child&#8221; (of either sex), of unknown origin; &#8230; Specific meaning of &#8220;female child&#8221; is 14c.*

<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="294" /></span>a bunch of years back, post-college, with a group of friends, we tried to get in the habit of addressing each other as a group as &#8220;girls&#8221; instead of &#8220;guys,&#8221; no matter the genders. (at my all women&#8217;s college, it was amazing how consistently an entire class of women would be referred to by their male professor as &#8220;you guys&#8221;.) someone in our group discovered that the root of &#8220;girl&#8221; meant a child of *either sex* so we decided to switch it around and try something different. the result? it&#8217;s amazing how hard it was to get out of the habit of saying &#8220;hey you guys&#8221;. really, try it!

even though the cover is pretty darn ugly, i&#8217;m considering buying the next harry potter book from a canadian publisher because there, the publisher, rainforest books, is printing it on [ recycled paper][6]. [via [bookslut][7]] greenpeace has a nice graphic of what this switch to recyled paper means in [in muggle terms and in hogwart terms][8]. hmm, the more i think about it, i don&#8217;t really like the cover art that much on the u.s. books anyhow. 

<span class="pic"><txp:image id="290" /></span>starting sunday, gulp, i&#8217;m joining [heidi][9] by going [refined sugar-free][10] for a week. like heidi, i love me some sweets, and i love carbs. but i need to get healthier and help my body, and i know sugar just isn&#8217;t doing that. i&#8217;m not too bad as i used to be in eating blatantly sugar-rich food all the time (coughanythinggummigcough), but it turns out there&#8217;s sugar everywhere, in places i didn&#8217;t even think about, like ketchup! 

this is going to disgust some, ok all, of you, but i love love ketchup &#8211; and that&#8217;s heinz, nothing special or fancy. my favorite use, since i was just a teeny kid, is (brace yourself) &#8211; ketchup with rice sprinkled with parmesan cheese. stop ewwwing, it&#8217;s delicious. i&#8217;m a tad embarassed about my love for that dish, i know [liz][11] and other healthy folks out there are probably aghast at my poor diet. <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> really i could live off that stuff for days. so bad. but come on, everyone has guilty unhealthy nasty-sounding food they love, right? and hey to me, ketchup on eggs, ugggghhhh. so there. 

lastly, the pics you see are of me and my sisters &#8211; i&#8217;ll show the rest of them next week (in the first pic, luci and i are being silly in the kitchen, and in the second, claudi is being a first-rate navigator in my rent-a-wreck). also, i seamed up the baby ballering top last night, yay! it&#8217;s lovely and so teeny, a lot of fun to fold over and over again. (that&#8217;s one of my favorite things about knitting &#8211; the satisfaction that comes from folding and admiring your finished knits &#8211; they feel like *real* clothing! how cool is that?!) also, tomorrow is my spinning class, wheeeee, so fun. pics from there for sure too.

have a fabulous weekend and enjoy the beautiful july weather!
