hi.

one more week till the winter quarter ends for ucla. argh. it really feels so drawn out and i am ready for spring break right. now. please. (sigh) i feel like i&#8217;ve run into so much great links, stories, and info lately.. here&#8217;s some:

first of all, though mentioned before, check out this incredible adbusters&#8217; short movie called &#8216;corporate crackdown&#8217;.

researching bolivia and its coca culture for an upcoming archives project, i found some great links: [cajpe][1], [andean information network][2], [bolivia indymedia][3], and [tni][4]. also, check out the u.s. embassy in bolivia&#8217;s cheapy ugly website at <a href=&#8221;

http://www.megalink.com/usemblapaz/&#8221;>www.megalink.com/usemblapaz/</a>.

stumbled across the library of congress&#8217; [minerva][5] project/site. &#8216;minerva&#8217; stands for &#8216;mapping the internet electronic resources virtual archive&#8217;. &#8220;the MINERVA web preservation project was established to initiate a broad program to collect and preserve [digitally born] primary source materials.&#8221; so far, it only has a few collection available to look at, notably their [september 11][6] collection. (not that there&#8217;s much information [on their site][7] but [webarchivist.org][7] looks like a great site/idea/future job..)

although a scary and undoubtably messed up group, the [global business network][8] seems to cover lots of different subjects. among their many reports: [&#8216;abrupt climate change&#8217;][9], a report requested by the pentagon wondering what the collapse of the climate due to global warming could mean to them and the world. (it&#8217;s not a pretty picture, as you can imagine, though pretty extreme sounding.) as for the rest of the reports, i can&#8217;t see them without logging in and, as the site states, &#8220;membership is available to organizations for $40,000 per year&#8221; and is not yet available for individuals. yikes/scary.

from [one library site][10], i got this great link to [concealed garments][11], a site dedicated to clothing deliberately concealed (that is, buried) in buidlings, for good luck, superstition, or who knows. it&#8217;s kinda scary to look at all the pictures, makes a shiver just run down my back. but still pretty interesting.

since the civil war, there has been only one execution of a u.s. soldier for desertion during wartime. [eddie slovik][12], a 24 year old soldier serving in france during world war 2, was killed by a firing squad during the last months of the war, on january 31, 1945. eisenhower personally ordered the execution and slovik was buried in a cemetary for disgraced u.s. soldiers who had been caught raping and/or murdering. (there&#8217;s a movie, starring martin sheen, about him, called &#8216;[the execution of private slovik][13]&#8217; that i want to see.)

[camilo mejia][14], seeking an honorable discharge as a conscientious objector, says, &#8220;the justification for this war is money and no soldier should go to iraq and give his life for oil.&#8221;

p.s. i just did a complete revamping of my [bolivia index page][15] and am now working on getting the other pages in that section to look equally nice!.. 

disgusting: from [feminste][16], [virgin airway&#8217;s clubhouse at jfk airport in nyc has men&#8217;s urinals shaped like women&#8217;s lips][17]. if there was ever a doubt, sexism is alive and well, thank you very much.
