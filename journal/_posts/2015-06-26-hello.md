today marks the beginning of winter vacation for our oldest daughter (now in pre-k, can you believe it!) and woah, i am happy about that. since she started in school in february, our life has been kicked up a few notches, with lots of going back and forth here and there, lots of planning and scheduling, and very little downtime. being a parent means there's no *true* downtime ever, really, but still, this feels like it could be just the big deep breath that i've been needing for weeks. 

i've been working on a few different projects for a while now, covering tech stuff, book stuff, and craftsy stuff. all the usual. ;) all of these i hope to progress on a bunch during the next two weeks.

let's see, tech-wise it's lately [amara.og](http://amara.org) to learn how to create valid HTML5 subtitles for videos, taking MOOCs via [edx.org](http://edx.org) like Harvard's CS50 and the W3C's HTML5 class, working my way ever so slowly through [Free Code Camp](http://freecodecodecamp.com), and more. lots of [codeacademy](http://codeacademy.com) and [codeschool](http://codeschool.com), oh and [bento](https://www.bento.io/) too. so many resources out there, it's bewildering but exciting. also i'm always playing around with this here (and others) [github pages](https://pages.github.com/), making sure i got [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) figured out and all that. 

as for the books side of things, i've been reading up a storm - well for adult me, at least. thirty+ books so far, and i've enjoyed all but one or two of them, and the vast majority i really liked, especially alan weisman's the world without us, ali smith's how to be both, frances hardinge's a face like glass, and ray bradbury's the martian chronicles. hmm, see [here](https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/1894759) for more. anyhow, i'm getting better at learning to say no to books that are boring, repetitive, bad, or pretentious - or even just books that aren't for me at that moment. it's a relief. i think i have enough ocd tendencies that i used to feel super uncomfortable with the idea of not finishing a book. ridiculous! life is too short, you know, to read bad books. i have some other book plans, big and small, but those are best not talking about until i have something to show for it. we shall see. hopefully.

and lastly, crafts. i've knitted one item this year. one. it took months - and i've decided to put it on our youngest backwards because the collar looks better that way. in other words, it wasn't a complete success. nonetheless, the knits from the past few years are still being used constantly, so that is a source of pride. cooking-wise, which is a craft, i've learned how to cook one particular bolivian dish, sajta it is called, very well and i'm so pleased. it involves cooking tunta too, which is a form of dehydrated potato, a specialty in bolivia. it tastes must better than the description sounds, but anyhow, i've always wondered how to cook it and now i know. it's easy, really. i keep meaning to document how to cook it so maybe that'll appear here some day. 

and that is that. happy friday ~ happy end of june ~ goodbye!
