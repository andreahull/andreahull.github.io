hi there! i&#8217;m typing this in a tiny cooped-up room with a weird keyboard that has all these strange keys like Ã² Ã¨ ï¿½ , with the possibility of sweating to death, but i&#8217;m happy. because i&#8217;m in positano, italy! incredible to be back in italy, i&#8217;m hit with so many memories every which way i look &#8211; and when i talk to people, i can feel the italian slowly (but ever so slowly, slower than last time i came to visit over five years ago. use it or lose it indeed.) coming back and i get such a thrill.

on saturday we head down to modica, near ragusa, on the eastern side of sicily. i love sicily like few places in the world &#8211; it&#8217;s the place of so many firsts for me. first time i ate salt on oranges (yum), kissed a boy, had a boyfriend at all, was away from my family for more than two weeks (instead, it was 6 months!), danced all night long at a club, ate ice cream every school day for weeks, skipped school, etc etc. a great great place. plus, sicilians are so sweet and direct. just the best.

it turns out it takes about two hours to go from modica to palermo (where i was an exchange student ten (!) years ago). last night, when i told my family that i was definitely going to go to palermo for at least a day or two they surprised me by saying they all wanted to go too. yay! i&#8217;m still in contact with my first boyfriend from so long ago and i&#8217;m just dying to see him and his family. ay, i can&#8217;t wait. it&#8217;s going to be so much fun..

more details later &#8212; i have to get on the internet mondays through friday for work reasons so i&#8217;ll be sure and write more here soon.
