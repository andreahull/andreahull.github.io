hello and happy 2005 to you ~

i *did* in fact [get a bed][1], after a lot of hard work and hassle, but will leave that fascinating story (really!) for another day when i have access to pics taken. the end result: i am blissfully happy about my bed and am amazed and a bit angry at myself that i didn&#8217;t get one much much sooner. 

lots of news going on in my neck of the woods, the least being the incredible mind-numbing amount of rain we&#8217;ve been getting here out in l.a. i swear it&#8217;s been raining cats & dogs practically non-stop since i got back! in the last 24 hours or so, there&#8217;s been a lull, but i&#8217;m not convinced it&#8217;s over. of course, my car window [that got broken into][2] a while back has yet to be replaced so, yup, my car is basically turning into a giant lovely specimen of mold. 

however, &#8216;old friends&#8217; is the title of this post and old friends is indeed what it&#8217;s about. i realized with a shock a few months back that 2005 marks not only the 5th anniversary of graduating from [college][3] but the *10th* anniversary of my [high school][4] graduation. shocked, speechless, i wondered what would i do, would i go to the planned reunion or not, should i try and contact old buddies now that my high school&#8217;s [web team][5] (alas that it didn&#8217;t exist when i went there.. yes, it would have marked me a dork for life but i would have known [web standards][6] at age 18, darn it) has set up an excellent [alumni site][7], etc etc. then, i got an email from an old friend, including some recent pics of her looking fabulous and happy. and now, just yesterday, i received another email from one of my best friends in high school with links to pictures from her recent wedding where she looks so incredibly happy and grown up. it&#8217;s all a bit bewildering but also great. 

hm. yes, folks, i&#8217;m all excited about getting a *bed* and others are excited about *being married*. sigh. (..not that i want to be married right now, not at all. i like my life a lot the way it is. but sometimes i want to feel normal in specific ways that i really really am not.) 

the main thing, however, is that in my last year of high school i just wanted, like so many seniors, to be out. of. there. and, unfortunately, this included me totally neglecting for the most part my high school friends. so, now, it&#8217;s very nice indeed to hear from them. these are the girls who i stayed up late all night playing [spit][8] with (great great game), eating jugs of still-powdered kool-aid, singing [silly][9] [songs][10] while driving fast speeds in un-parented cars, going to football rallies with, having water fights in the summer, and writing tons and tons of [notes][11] during classes. ah, those were fun days and the only other people who really remember them are these girls (and a few boys) who for a bunch of years were the main people in my life. is it too late to make up and be friends again?
