such a sleepy thursday, yawwwn. ok, i&#8217;m up, i&#8217;m up, i swear.

the new spring issue of [you grow girl][1] is out with the theme &#8216;beginner&#8217;. appropriately, my two reviews are there, one for [mcgee & stuckey&#8217;s: the boutiful container][2] and the other on sarah stein&#8217;s [noah&#8217;s garden: restoring the ecology of our own backyards][3]. both are very good, especially stein&#8217;s for just pure daydreaming reasons if nothing else.

i&#8217;ve been accepted into the r.a.o.k. ring! very exciting &#8212;and though i was very relieved to see my knitting stash is not so large as some (phew), it&#8217;s still a little too big for my comfort level, so i&#8217;ll be de-stashing soon (at least at little bit&#8230; obviously, i&#8217;m still trying to convince myself.) also, some knitting books i have i&#8217;m just not crazy about and i know others would appreciate them more. for the books, however, i was thinking i&#8217;d offer them to any of the ladies that read this here journal first, if you want them. trades are happily welcomed &#8211; for yarn, mags (old copies of interweave&#8217;s knits or, especially!, old rebeccas, rowan, or phildar mags! it&#8217;s so exciting to even just *think* about trades, hee.), or anything otherwise, but if not, and i really like you ;), i&#8217;ll just send a book trade-free.

up for grabs: 

  * ~ <strike>[erika knight&#8217;s simple knits with a twist][4]</strike>
  * ~ [debbie bliss&#8217; simple living][5]
  * ~ <strike>[ann budd&#8217;s the knitter&#8217;s handy book of sweater patterns][6]</strike>

i watched *finding neverland* last night&#8212;everyone i had talked to who had seen it told me they cried watching it, so i resisted. i felt either two things would happen: a) i&#8217;d cry, and i don&#8217;t like crying when it&#8217;s about movies, or b) i wouldn&#8217;t and instead would want to roll my eyes in annoyance at the cloying artificialness of the supposed crying scene. no surprise, i&#8217;m sure, that option a happened &#8211; buckets in fact. embarassing, but there it is.

sometime today or tomorrow i&#8217;m officially switching over to my new [hosting people (textdrive.com!)][7] so if this site is down, don&#8217;t be alarmed ;), it&#8217;ll all be up and running by sunday at the latest. 

ooh! the [new knitty][8] is up! my favorite are the [cute beach bags][9]&#8230;
