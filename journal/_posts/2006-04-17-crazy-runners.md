my dad is running the [boston marathon][1] *right now*. there&#8217;s this new feature this year where the runner can have emails, text messages, etc sent automatically to a few people, giving them an update of the actual time for that runner. my dad said something about a <span class="caps">RFID</span> tag that he ties on his shoe? i&#8217;ll have to ask for details, and a photo!, later. anyhow, here&#8217;s what i have so far:

110th Boston Marathon 2006

At 1:45 PM, Charles H at 21K.

Pace: 04:40  
Projected Finish Time: 3:16:30 (Net)

he&#8217;s got 21 km to go! he said he&#8217;d be happy with anything around 3 1/2 hours, so he&#8217;s doing great so far, seems to me. especially considering he got some big ole splinter in his foot the other day and hasn&#8217;t yet managed to get it out. ! he said he didn&#8217;t want to make his foot more sore, so he figured he&#8217;d just double up on socks. crrrrrazy. 

this is his 5th boston marathon and after this he plans on running the marathon in rome. go poppy go! 

update: 

At 3:36 PM, Charles H has finished.  
Pace: 04:57 per km  
Finish Time: 3:28:41

yay yay!
