~ it&#8217;s friday the thirteenth! makes me feel all jitterly like *anything* can happen. makes me feel upbeat, like yelling out &#8216;huzzah!&#8217;

~ i recently not only bought fancy nailpolish but actually painted it on in an effort to grow my nails out which, and i&#8217;m blaming knitting not my nasty nail-biting habits!, had grown horribly short, painfully short, especially on my thumbs. did you know you can find metallic nailpolish nowadays? i got silver and an aqua blue &#8211; they&#8217;re fantastic and i feel like a superstah. 

~ confession: i knit while driving. now, not high-speed driving, i promise, the needles and project just stay in my lap and keep me company at those times, but l.a. traffic is all what you&#8217;ve heard it to be and at those bumper-to-bumper times, the law be damned. tell me i&#8217;m not the only one! ..at least i barely read any more while driving &#8211; i used to do that alll the time. (though i saw a guy doing that the other day and it was so darn cute.)

~ i&#8217;m having my first meetup with a fellow blogger/knitter, [winnie][1], she of the lovely finished lucky sweater and gorgeous hot lava jacket. i&#8217;m a bit nervous, it feels like a blind date in a way!, but as there&#8217;ll be yarn and phildar mags and needles flying, i&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll have an awesome time.

~ [liz][2] tagged me for this fun meme &#8211; and the first three ladies to comment who want it, take it away! 

The Rules: Pick 5 of the following and then complete the sentences. Then pass this little meme on to 3 more of your blog friends! But no tag backs! And be carefulâ€¦you could be next!

The Premise (pick any 5):

If I could be&#8230; 

a scientist, a farmer, a musician, a doctor, a painter, a gardener, a missionary, a chef, an architect, a linguist, a psychologist, a librarian, an athlete, a lawyer, an inn-keeper, a professor, a writer, a llama-rider, a bonnie pirate, an astronaut, a world famous blogger, a justice on any one court in the world, married to any current famous political figureâ€¦

The answers &#8230;.

1) if i could be a musician&#8230; i&#8217;d play whenever i was feeling sad, to cheeer me up. i wouldn&#8217;t be in a band, though maybe i&#8217;d play with friends now and then. mostly it would be a selfish thing only shared to those who inspire me. i&#8217;d play acoustic guitar, bass, and banjo &#8211; all three i love. oh and maybe drumming, just beause it looks so fun and physically satisfying.

2) if i could be an inn-keeper&#8230; it&#8217;d be this fabulous cozy inn on the coast of oregon, where the forest meets the cliffs of the pacific. i&#8217;d only have it open for business specific weeks of every month, the rest of the time it would be a home just for me, with regular visits from my fabulous family and friends. there&#8217;d be fireplaces galore and tons of cross-circulating windows. also, many cats and dogs. 

3) if i could be a gardener&#8230; i&#8217;d have dirt under my nails constantly, i&#8217;d have a farmer&#8217;s tan (rather than the pasty white i am now), and i&#8217;d have thighs of steel from squatting all the time. i&#8217;d grow everything edible under the sun, and i&#8217;d share my seeds, and i&#8217;d cackle with delight at growing closer to becoming the wild woman i always wanted to be.

4) if i could be a writer&#8230; i&#8217;d write one book that made me rich enough i&#8217;d never *have* to have a 9 to 5 job ever again. i&#8217;d feel just fine at have only one best-seller and would take years and years before i finally wrote one or two more that were modest sucesses,but for me, were the satisfying results of a good life.

5) if i could be a bonnie pirate&#8230; i&#8217;d retire and just roam the seas with my boy, my cats, and a good wireless connection. i&#8217;d stay bonnie till the end of my days.
