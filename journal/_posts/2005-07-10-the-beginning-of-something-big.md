title: the beginning of something big

or rather the middle of it, maybe. i&#8217;m talking about fiber, about yarn, about cloth, about textures and colors and warmth, oh my. 

<div style="text-align: center; border: 1px dotted silver; padding-top: 11px; margin: 7px;">
  <txp:jmr_gallery category="328" />
</div>

the beginning was years ago, when i started getting really really into weaving &#8211; not that i did any, i just devoured book after book about weaving, cardweaving, rughooking even, loom weaving, everything. (though *they* might have forgotten about it by now, i never will! hee.) ultimately, i did some card weaving, sighed over looms, read desicriptions of week-long classes at [the mannings][1] and ultimately decided to devote more time to book-making, which is also fiber-related and, most importantly, cheaper. 

then, about a year and a half ago, i watched [amanda start knitting][2] and just like that i got bit finally by the persistent knitting bug. so i started and that was that. or so i thought. but now this spinning thing &#8211; hmm, it&#8217;s worrying me. it&#8217;s making me think i&#8217;m going to go just hog-wild with fiber. and the word fiber just hasn&#8217;t ever, and still doesn&#8217;t, inspire a whole lot in me. it&#8217;s just not the prettiest word. but [spinning][3]? and spindle? and treadle? and roving? ah, beautiful words they are, making me feel like i&#8217;m in a fairy tale, or involved in magic, which just sucks me right in. 

for others, the sign that one is truly into spinning would be the buying of a [wheel][4] (or dare i say, multiple wheels) and stocking up of roving. me, i&#8217;m already looking at attending [SOAR][5], Spin Off&#8217;s Annual Retreat &#8211; not this year, but maybe next year or the year after. call me crazy but first read [this review][6] [from knitters reivew] and then call me names if you wish.

me? i just want to dive in with both feet &#8211; the class was amazing and, for anyone else in the so. cal. area that wants to try spinning, i can&#8217;t recommend more highly the weaver&#8217;s cottage&#8217;s classes &#8211; as well as cheryl ambrose, the teacher. she was excellent, thorough, patient and just so sweet. i&#8217;ll definitely be back and for now, i just can&#8217;t stop staring at this beautiful traveller wheel &#8211; it&#8217;s mine for a week!
