after all my freaking out, this sweater turned out beautifully and, to my eye at least, perfectly. verdict? i love it! *and* this sweater has proved me wrong about acrylics&#8212;knitting with it was not fun but the feel of it now, all plushy and soft, it&#8217;s making me rethink my feelings about acrylics.

as you can see in the second image, the body part is slightly snugger than i think the pattern calls for, but it works well and isn&#8217;t the least bit uncomfortable. the sleeves are heavenly&#8212;just long enough and such a lovely shape. the collar was my last concern, and i almost changed the neckline, but i&#8217;m glad i stuck with the pattern: such a bulky yarn has to be committed to all the way, so bulk up and enjoy the warmth! 

and about that warmth, thank goodness i work in an archives&#8212;otherwise this sweater would go to waste in sunny los angeles.. but in the archives, it&#8217;s *always* sweater-time.
