<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="1132" /></span>ah, my birthday month is almost over. in the future, i&#8217;ll remember this month as the month i finally started to make plans again. see, after college &#8211; and after an unhappy and stressed out senior year, where i *just barely* graduated thanks to [an understanding professor][1] &#8211; i headed out to the west coast and was determined, i remember, to not make any plans further than a month out. at the time, the idea was that i&#8217;d been a student for so long, with whole years marked out and planned way in advance, that finally, i clearly really really needed a break. and that&#8217;s what i did. i took about three years, making no plans and just following my interests. i felt lost and bewildered at times, sure, and wow, was it hard to get across to people why this was important for me to do and what it was i was doing, but looking back.. those were some awesome years. i learned a lot and explored so much and ah, sometimes i think &#8220;glory days&#8221;? ack, i hope not &#8211; i want them ahead of me, always elusively around the corner. anyhow. <span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="1130" /></span>

fast forward to today, or the near past, i graduate from library school, and yup, once again, i have absolutely no wish to start planning. i think almost all of my classmates jumped straight into careers, which i&#8217;m kinda envious of. i know this whole not-working thing is a luxury that a lot of people don&#8217;t have &#8211; i know, i&#8217;m lucky &#8211; but i&#8217;ve also made choices that help that luck along a little bit at least, like no kids, no mortgage, no car payments even, just cats. <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> anyhow, i&#8217;m digressing, my point is that i basically came back to maryland because a while back, when starting library school, i promised my family i&#8217;d return after school was over, and so i did. beyond the fulfillment of that promise-made-years-ago, i haven&#8217;t made any real life plans (i.e. long term plans) since early 2006. <span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="1133" /></span>i&#8217;ve daydreamed like anyone else, but there&#8217;s been no real substance.. i&#8217;m so jinxing myself, but oh well: this month, finally, some plans. they&#8217;re just little tentative dust bunnies in the corners of my mind, but you know how those tend to accumulate and grow.. well, we&#8217;ll see, we&#8217;ll see.

and the geography part of the plans is still totally up in the air, but hey, at least i&#8217;m actively participating in where my life goes again, rather than letting old promises (that i&#8217;m mostly glad i kept, don&#8217;t worry) and even older habits lead the way. that&#8217;s progress. for someone who tends to think micro and forget about the macro, that&#8217;s all the more progress. along with this comes getting involved in the world immediately around me a bit, i.e. taking classes, going to shows and conferences, researching local places, volunteering, etc. i like that part a lot, but oh it can&#8217;t be forced. 

..and because i like to throw in some fun randomness along with the melodrama, here&#8217;s me letterpressing last week (with some pics on the side as well):

  
i was all blushing in the video, and nervous smiley in the beginning, but doesn&#8217;t it look like fun? .. i missed my [latest class][2] today because i got lost on the beltway (the highway that circles d.c.) and ended up on a lovely highway-tour of northeastern d.c. and northern virginia. argh. [btw, if you have trouble seeing the video above, try [here][3]]

i&#8217;m thinking a lot of posts this last week of march &#8211; one a day. can i do it? and why? for one, why not. for two, oh there&#8217;s too much that i planned and yet pussyfooted around, so i gotta squeeze them in before march ends. there will be more basket stuff (glad you all liked that), a FO or two or three, and some new projects, plus lots more me-me-me, you know. <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> then, hopefully, april will start clean and fresh. 

to make this even longer &#8211; hey knitters, have you checked out lauren&#8217;s [recent][4] [posts][5]? there&#8217;s some interesting discussion going on in the comments regarding IK and the new changes going on.
