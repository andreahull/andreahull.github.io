what to make next? 

i&#8217;m in the middle of several project so the part of me that is responsible (so small!) says i should finish those: one [kitty pi][1], my tammy sweater for once and for all, a felted pouch-thing, those baby booties, and, gulp, my band-aid-colored-and-feeling socks. 

..but i got money from my mom and sister for yarn!! and [knitpicks][2] continues to call and calllll to me. and then [the knitting garden][3] is having a big old sale on [araucania nature cotton][4] plus they sent out a <strike>10%</strike> 15%! discount code-thing on top of that (*psst. look in comments for code*) and oh! that nature cotton looks just as heavenly as the inca cotton i used in [my first sweater][5] that i still loved to just sit and pet. i don&#8217;t care about pilling, i don&#8217;t care about shedding (well, i do. but not too much.), i just want it to be a dream to knit up and a dream to hold, and that nature cotton seems to promise all that and more. ah, and [the pink][6] is really beautiful and so spring-happy.

so, trying to resist temptation, i took pics of all my [stash][7] and now i&#8217;m embarassed at how much my stash overfloweth. yikes. *and* (you can tell i&#8217;m in yarn-agony here, i hope), the local stitch n bitch is having a collective yarn sale this weekend &#8212; ahhhh! 

on top of all this, though i&#8217;m absolutely coveting some yarn, i can&#8217;t seem to decide on what to make. i want another big comfy cotton-y sweater (oh, that pink yarn!) and i&#8217;d love to make something delicate and lacy. and something else to cozy up with at night, watching tv or doing homework (ha!) &#8212; but then once i pick a pattern, i get all flakey and start reconsidering. 

ah, i recognize this: the procrastination blues. i have two big papers due this week, on friday, and so what am i doing? i&#8217;m busy as a bee&#8230; about knitting. school? what school?
