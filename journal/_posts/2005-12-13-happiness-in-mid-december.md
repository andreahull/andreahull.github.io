hi there <span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="755" /></span> ~ woke up this morning super chirpy and happy &#8211; phew, it&#8217;s been a while! of course, it can&#8217;t hurt that i got ten hours of sleep last night, yay. i just crashed after eating a quick dinner (that even my mom would&#8217;ve approved of, for once) and woke up gloriously stretching in that very satisfied-sleep kind of way. there&#8217;s a lot of work to do today, but bring it on, i&#8217;m ready <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> 

ok, so here&#8217;s evidence of my crazy shopping spree this weekend <span class="picl"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="756" /></span>- instead of studying and writing papers, i shopped. almost all on sale, and all totally unusal and mostly handmade, but still, all together, a heck of a lot of stuff. and i broke the golden rule of christmas, at least in my family, &#8220;don&#8217;t buy anything for yourself right before chirstmas &#8211; we might be getting it for you!&#8221; ah well, sorry family. couldn&#8217;t resist.

so here we go. <span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="757" /></span>first off, the [weavers&#8217; cottage][1] had their tremendous annual &#8220;buy it so we don&#8217;t have to inventory it&#8221; sale with 40% just about everything, including almost all fiber and yarn. amazing! i limited my self to only fiber and a book, see?

at less than a dollar an ounce, that&#8217;s five ounces each of merino top in coral, gold, plum, and white. then 6 ounces of white soy silk that didn&#8217;t photograph very well but is one of the softest things i&#8217;ve *ever* touched in my life. [deb menz][2]&#8217; book on color &#8211; she has another excellent one, but for now, this one is knocking my socks off. <span class="picl"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="758" /></span> and last but not least, the luxury fiber grab bag seen in the basket &#8211; from left to right, there&#8217;s baby alpaca in brown and white, cashmere top in white, baby camel in brown, yak cloud in black, and some white silk hankies. wow! now if only i had a spinning wheel.. ahem.

next, the bazaar bizarre haul: <span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="759" /></span>first off, i&#8217;ve always been into spindly delicate looking necklaces, but for some reason on sunday, all of a sudden chunky pendants were all that was catching my eye. see, three of them! one very gothic-y risque (by [photomonium][3]), another just glittery and weird (by [soopajdelux][4]), and the last, my favorite, a snow scene (by [sproutstudio][5]) to keep my company in this l.a. land. aren&#8217;t they all beautiful! i love them &#8211; each so different, both for me and from each other.

then, some hair decoration. i&#8217;m all about bobby pins, love love them. so these three special ones make me happy. <span class="picl"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="762" /></span>  
i love the way the [blissen][6] one will, i know it will!, shape itself to my head in a really pretty way. and the crocheted cherries, what&#8217;s not to like! 

next up, buttons! went a little crazy, couldn&#8217;t help it. so cute, so cheap (all the ones on the right came from [boygirlparty][7] &#8211; i love the birds especially.) then, some art. if i ever write a children&#8217;s story &#8211; and though i emphatically denied it for years and years (&#8220;i&#8217;m a reader, not a writer!&#8221;), it has crossed my brain a few times this year &#8211; i would choose [jaime zollars][8] as my illustrator. isn&#8217;t that picture lovely? the detail and color choices are lush and mysterious and sweet. 

then, clothing time &#8211; <span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="760" /></span>just a very nice shirt with weird green monkey plants (from [crowded teeth][9]), i&#8217;m wearing it right now. and that cute wristband (from [chebang][10]) that looks like it grew in the jungle. and, the whole reason i went to the bazaar in the first place, my new wallet! i just love [jill bliss][6]&#8217; stuff &#8211; and this wallet is just another great thing of hers. made of bedsheets, so it&#8217;ll just get softer with time, i love it.<span class="picl"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="761" /></span>

phew! that&#8217;s it. a whole lot of shopping, i know. i probably won&#8217;t do something like that again till next year, but boy it was fun. <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> lastly, my trouble cat here &#8211; isn&#8217;t she sweet? she had an exciting but scary trip out to the vet yesterday and everyone was cooing over her, she&#8217;s such a sweetie. this pic is for you, lalitha <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" />

happy mid-december ~ remember, it&#8217;s the process that counts! grrroan, i know, but still. it&#8217;s true. see you later ~ ~
