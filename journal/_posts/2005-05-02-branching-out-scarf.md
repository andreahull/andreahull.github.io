finished: may 1, 2005  
pattern: knitty&#8217;s [branching out][1] by the talented [susan][2]  
yarn: 1 skein of elizabeth lavold&#8217;s silky wool, in plum. i *love* this yarn.  
needles: size 7 metal inoxes. 

first off, i realized while knitting this that i don&#8217;t like straights very much, espeically long metal ones. argh. too slippery. also, i probably should&#8217;ve knitted a larger size but i was too cheap to go out and buy some size 8s..!

other than that, this was a fun relatively-fast knit, and my second try at lace. lace is fun fun fun, though sometimes i felt like i was going cross-eyed, trying to figure out what i&#8217;d done wrong.

oh! and one word of warning: DO NOT TRY AND KNIT LACE WHILE DRUNK, or even slightly tipsy. sunday morning i woke up and picked up my knitting, to continue what i thought of as my very produtive saturday &#8216;knitting and wine&#8217; night and what i saw looked *nothing* like the pattern&#8212;instead of branching out, i had a total nightmare jungle, a branching out stephen-king-style. 

i don&#8217;t know how my buzzed mind could even think for a moment that what i had knit was ok but i distinctly remember nodding with pride at my scarf before i put it down and went off to a (hazy) sleep. hm.

if you&#8217;re working on branching out, or want to see more example of it, check out this [knitalong site][3] &#8211; and think about joining!

by the way, that&#8217;s my sweet mama cat there. it&#8217;s funny, at the vets, they kept calling her &#8216;mama&#8217; as if &#8216;cat&#8217; were her last name. hee, mrs. cat. <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" />
