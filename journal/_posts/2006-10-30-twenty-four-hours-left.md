<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="984" /></span>it&#8217;s amazing how echoes can change the feel of a place. i woke up this morning, not recognizing where i was, despite the familiar feel of the raspy spring-sprung sofa against my cheek&#8230; my apartment just *sounds* empty and it feels like what i knew of it, what i&#8217;d made of it for sure, is irrevocably gone. like it never was. i like to think though that these walls and floors and windows have absorbed the living i have done in it over the past three and a half years &#8211; the good and the bad, the heartbreak and the crazy happy joy and laughter. ah. too many emotions ~ and now, it&#8217;s in this half-state that just makes my heart ache to see and, surprisingly, *hear* the changes, the finality of it all.

of course, i&#8217;m so excited about going to maryland ~ and so grateful of friends and family that have helped me this past week, especially last night during my goodbye-party-turned-moving-party ~ but this goodbye just chokes me up. like with any friendship, there&#8217;s no real way to convey the depth of feelings so it&#8217;s best to leave with a good warm hug and a big smile, right? except, how do you hug an apartment? silly me.
