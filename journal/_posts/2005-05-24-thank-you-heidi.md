<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="255" /></span>class break, but i had to post these three pictures. the first is my ella tank, done and drying&#8212;it&#8217;s all rib basically, so i scrunched it up so it wouldn&#8217;t lose the rib elasticity, especially as it&#8217;s a cotton blend and doesn&#8217;t have much elasticity to begin with. better pics coming soon, i hope. also, corrections for the pattern which was totally whack &#8211; say crucial mistakes like saying &#8216;C4L&#8217; (cable four left) when they really meant &#8216;C4B&#8217; (cable four back). easily fixed once i realized what was going on, but until then, agggh. however, at the end of it all, i think it was a good first cabling project &#8211; not too boring and definitely makes you really understand how cabling is done.

the second is of an incredibly thoughtful gift i received this past weekend from [heidi ][1] ~ oh it so made my day! and whenever i look at it, i just get happy. isn&#8217;t it gorgeous?! it came with two matching potholders (but of course! <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> ) and a photocopy of an essay heidi had told me about [a while back][2]. she had [hinted][3] on her (fabulous) [site][1] last week that she was making (creweling/couching) a gift for someone and that if their initials had an &#8216;r&#8217; in it, then it could be them she was making it for&#8230; i playfully commented saying i had an &#8216;r&#8217; in my name but i doubted it was for me. <img src="http://localhost:8888/wordpress/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> and then lo and behold! wow, i so love it. heidi is a truely cool craftsy woman ~ and her timing was perfect, making a sad day sweeter and happier than it would&#8217;ve been otherwise. 

<span class="pic"><txp:thumbnail poplink="1" id="258" /></span>and lastly, my niece received [her baptism gift][4] from me &#8211; but look at the pic closely and you should start laughing like crazy. i love my sister so much but i had to write her immediately an email full of exclamation points and smileys, explaining that she had put the bonnet on kiyra *upside down*! too funny. and i love kiyra&#8217;s face, like &#8216;uhhh, i don&#8217;t know about this bonnet-thing..&#8217; 

and in some great library news, i just got word that i will be co-presenting at the california library association&#8217;s annual conference this fall! it&#8217;s a group session, entitled &#8220;Blah, Blah, Blah, Blog&#8221; and will feature yours truly as well as Sarah Houghton, of the wonderful [Librarian in Black][5], Susan Rosenblatt, and Susan Fisher. i&#8217;m nervous about it &#8211; especially since i have experience with blogs, of course, and even blogs and archives (i never posted about that, did i?), but i&#8217;ve never worked in a library. no worries, it&#8217;ll be great, i&#8217;m sure, and i&#8217;m very excited to be working on this project with these three ladies. yay. 

p.s. i&#8217;m thinking about changing the background here but i&#8217;m not sure where to go next&#8212;so far i&#8217;ve thought about caves, the moon, and underwater. any suugestions?
