lately it seems every day friends are pointing out more clips, thirty second movies, and ads all about the upcoming presidential elections, so i thought i&#8217;d put them all together in one place.

unfortunately, for some of these you need real player. for other non-realplayer files, i&#8217;m happy to report that [vlc][1] workes very well on mac *and* pcs and it&#8217;s neither proprietary nor complicated to set up or run. it runs wmv, mov, avi, and lots more, so try it out. 

**update**: well it seems [the internet archive&#8217;s election 2004][2] coverage, with an impressive 400+ movies, clips and more, basically has everything i list below, but i figure i&#8217;ll leave the list since sometimes their server is a bit overloaded. 

  * &#187; [moveonpac.org][3]: they&#8217;re constantly putting out new ones
  * &#187; [errolmorris.com election &#8216;04][4]: dozens of ads, really good
  * &#187; [bush pre-senile dementia video][5]
  * &#187; [bushin30seconds.org][6]: the top 150 video finalists
  * &#187; [terizm, terizm, terizm][7]: from [joi ito&#8217;s site][8]
  * &#187; [not there movie][9] from [operation truth][10]
  * &#187; <a href=="http://www.n3t.net/humor/Seriously.mpg">seriously</a>
  * &#187; last but not least, [p2p-politics.org][11], set up by [larry lessig][12] and others

i haven&#8217;t checked these out yet, but here&#8217;s some more:

  * &#187; <a hre="http://realvoices.org/rv/tv.html">realvoices</a>
  * &#187; [inhisownwords.org][13]

ok, now a favorite:

  * &#187; it&#8217;s not about the election per se but it&#8217;s really funny and still pertinent: [zefrank][14]&#8217;s redalert, whcih i&#8217;ve mirrored [here][15]

it&#8217;s been raining like crazy in l.a. the past three or four days. i love love! rain but haven&#8217;t been able to really appreciate it this time except for a little bit on tuesday ~ i&#8217;m either stuck at work or feeling sad in my apartment. 

oh. my apartment is a *mess*. they fumigated (!) the building last week and i had to dump everthing into my one &#8216;room&#8217; (i live in a single, joy joy). one good thing is that i&#8217;ve sorted out what i really truly don&#8217;t need, and haven&#8217;t touched in months, which i now have piled by the door to take out once the rain goes away. until then, though, i&#8217;m stuck with a pile of ordered and unordered *stuff* . 

i&#8217;ve been in a funk for a while now. moody moody. yuck. don&#8217;t know why exactly because even if some things are looking up (any number of things: money, job, school, friends, whatever), i still feel purpose-less and quiet, you know what i mean? anyway you look at it, i&#8217;m not terribly happy. i&#8217;m *ok*, you know; i&#8217;m one of those people that will *always* be &#8220;o.k&#8221;. i&#8217;m just not happy on any kind of regular steady basis. i feel restless and kinda clausterphobic. 

for weeks and weeks now, one of my favorite ways of going to sleep is to imagine how i will live in the future, how my apartment (either this one or a future imaginary one) will look and how happy i&#8217;ll be in it. pppft.

(later: i have to clarify that my living situation is far far better than it has been for literally years. but it&#8217;s the easiest problem to diagnose and one that doesn&#8217;t seem insurmountable. arg.)
