hm, nevermind the later:

my sister claudin is here visiting for a week and we&#8217;ve already packed more into the last four days than i usually do in two weeks. of course, no work makes that easy &#8211; as do lovely events like the &#8220;fabulous fiber fest&#8221; (must be said with giant exclamation marks in your voice, it&#8217;s so very fun to do) where we ran into [julia][1] (who posted a cute pic of claudi and me, and one of me spinning) and [marnie][2], which is always great. i didn&#8217;t go crazy but got some lovely fiber ([pygora][3] and a [grafton batt][4] of merino, plus some exotic fiber from a friend) &#8211; and notice the lovely glitter mascara? i like some fun makeup now and then, and glitter *always* receives a happy &#8216;yay!&#8217; 

on sunday [caroline][5], claudi and me went to the hollywood farmer&#8217;s market for their annual [heirloom][6] tomato festival. claudi, ever the professional/fanatical runner, ran in griffith park later that day while i took shots of the food haul, yum. 

more happened since (today was our beverly hills day, with a nice celebrity sighting, etc, tomorrow is all santa monica with hopefully some bike rentals), and claudi has fotos too &#8211; plus a trip to the bay area is planned for thurs and friday, and so on and so forth. yay.

happy late august everyone~ ~
