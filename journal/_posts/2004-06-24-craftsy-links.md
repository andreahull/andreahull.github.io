hello!

i&#8217;m on a real craftsy kick, at least reading-wise (it remains to be seen if i make anything or not..) so, i&#8217;ve been frequenting several boards and sites, particularly [getcraftsy][1]&#8216;s forum (**update:** and yet <strike>another</strike> two more craft/diy sites, [super naturale][2], yay! their [glitter forum][3] is greatgreat. & [the church of craft][4], bizarre and inspiring.), [ibuydiy][5], [seeds of change][6] (too late for me to do/help with gardening, but i can look at pretty greens and flowers anyway), and checking out lots of fun to-do books from the library, like [stich n&#8217; bitch][7], [fresh from the vegetarian slow cooker][8], and [knit one, felt too][9].

i&#8217;m thinking of joining the [local stitch n bitch][10] listserv (and i&#8217;d really like to get a look at their events calendar) and i just sent off a rsvp to [a drop spindle class][11] for next wedneday night. also, a few years back, vacya and i went on some wild food walks with this woman, hilla futterman ~ i still can identify wild mustards, miner&#8217;s lettuce, ice plant just from walking with her for a few hours a couple of saturdays in a row. anywhow, she&#8217;s offering two sunday morning walks through [lacc][12]&#8216;s summer classes, so i might do that too. the good thing about all these events is that they&#8217;re at most three hours long and either very cheap or free so i feel like flaking at the last moment, no big deal. mini-detox, indeed.

also, some more unschooling links: [the unprocessed child][22] and [definitions of unschooling][23], and i&#8217;d like to get this zine called [edgy&#8217;catin mama][24] ($8 from Nina Packebush  
1102 Hiatt Ct. Sultan, WA 98294) (**update:** yahoo, i found their [online forum][25]), [school free zone][26] and [learning in freedom][27].
